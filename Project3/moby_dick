P. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this series of stories for children has endeavored simply\r\nto show why and how the descendants of the early colonists fought\r\ntheir way through the wilderness in search of new homes. The several\r\nnarratives deal with the struggles of those adventurous people who\r\nforced their way westward, ever westward, whether in hope of gain or\r\nin answer to "the call of the wild," and who, in so doing, wrote their\r\nnames with their blood across this country of ours from the Ohio to the\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nTo excite in the hearts of the young people of this land a desire to\r\nknow more regarding the building up of this great nation, and at the\r\nsame time to entertain in such a manner as may stimulate to noble\r\ndeeds, is the real aim of these stories. In them there is nothing of\r\nromance, but only a careful, truthful record of the part played by\r\nchildren in the great battles with those forces, human as well as\r\nnatural, which, for so long a time, held a vast portion of this broad\r\nland against the advance of home seekers.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge of what has been done by our own people in our own\r\nland, surely there is no reason why one should resort to fiction in\r\norder to depict scenes of heroism, daring, and sublime disregard of\r\nsuffering in nearly every form.\r\n\r\n

I.]\r\n\r\nIt seems a very long while since I promised to tell you of what I did\r\nafter coming into this Ohio country, and yet even now I cannot well\r\nbegin the tale without telling something about the Ohio Company, which\r\nwas formed, as you know, by General Rufus Putnam.\r\n\r\nTwice I have begun the story, and twice I have stopped, understanding\r\nthat you would not be able to make out why we did this or that, unless\r\nyou first knew how it chanced that we came to make our homes here.\r\n\r\nWhen you and I, while we were both in Massachusetts, talked about my\r\njourneying into this country, I may have spoken in such a way as to\r\ngive you the idea that I believed it would be possible for me to do\r\nmuch toward the making of a new town.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I did really then believe that my services would be of great\r\nvalue to those men who expected to build a village here on the\r\nMuskingum River; but, although only two years have passed, I already\r\nunderstand that a boy of my age is not of much worth in such an\r\nenterprise, more particularly when men like Parson Cutler and General\r\nPutnam are at the head of affairs.\r\n\r\nDo you remember how old I am? Well, there is here in this town of\r\nMarietta a fellow by the name of Jeremy Salter, who has become quite a\r\nfriend of mine, and the other day he asked my age.\r\n\r\nI told him that I was born in December of the year of the capture of\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point, the election of General Washington to be\r\ncommander in chief of the armies, and the battle of Bunker Hill, yet,\r\nif you will believe me, the dolt was not able to fix the date.\r\n\r\nHowever, my age has nothing to do with our coming from Mattapoisett\r\ninto Ohio, and now let me try to make it plain how it happened that we\r\nof Massachusetts could come so far away and take up land simply because\r\nof having bought shares in the Ohio Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE OHIO COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the story as I have heard it from General Putnam himself. It\r\nseems that when our war for independence came to an end, the government\r\ndid not have money enough with which to pay the soldiers for their\r\nservices, or, as Parson Cutler says, the country was much the same\r\nas bankrupt; General Washington himself declared that a wagonload of\r\nContinental money would be hardly sufficient to purchase a wagonload of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nNow of course these soldiers must have their wages, and some men in the\r\nCongress proposed that the government sell land in the western country\r\nin order to raise enough money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rufus Putnam surveying land with Ben Tupper.]\r\n\r\nWhile this matter was being talked about, Congress ordered that a\r\nsurvey be made of the western lands, and Rufus Putnam himself received\r\nan appointment as one of the surveyors; but, not being able to attend\r\nto the work personally, he induced an old comrade, by the name of\r\nBenjamin Tupper, to take his place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meeting of the citizens of Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nWhen Master Tupper came back to the eastern colonies, after having\r\nbeen over the land, he told General Putnam what a great, grand country\r\nit was; and it is said that the two old comrades sat up all night\r\ntalking over plans for buying land enough to form a colony, and that\r\nby daybreak they had decided to call a meeting of the citizens of\r\nMassachusetts and the near-by states, to be held at the Bunch of Grapes\r\ntavern in Boston, early in the month of March, 1786. This meeting was\r\nheld, and a company was organized, to be known as the Ohio Associates.\r\n\r\nThe government had decided to use this land, as I have said, to pay\r\noff the soldiers, and this company, formed by General Putnam, employed\r\nParson Manasseh Cutler and Master Winthrop Sargent to make a bargain\r\nwith Congress. These two men offered to buy one million, five hundred\r\nthousand acres of land at one dollar an acre, paying down five hundred\r\nthousand dollars when the contract was signed, with the debts due the\r\nsoldiers reckoned as so much ready money.\r\n\r\nThose who had banded themselves together could not raise the remaining\r\nmillion dollars, and the result was that the government cut down the\r\nagreement so that our Ohio Company had at its disposal a little more\r\nthan a million acres of land, instead of a million and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RUFUS PUTNAM\r\n\r\n\r\nYou surely remember what General Putnam has done for his country,\r\nor, I should say, what he did, even before he came to Ohio. In 1757,\r\nwhen only nineteen years old, he enlisted as a common soldier in\r\nthe Provincial army,--for there was then war between England and\r\nFrance,--and served faithfully four years, until the surrender of\r\nMontreal, when the army was disbanded. Then he went to his home in New\r\nBraintree and worked at the trade of millwright; but he soon discovered\r\nthat his education was not sufficient to enable him to continue the\r\nbusiness to the best advantage, therefore he devoted every moment of\r\nhis spare time to the study of mathematics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rufus Putnam Studying Mathematics.]\r\n\r\nSeven or eight years afterward, when it was believed the British\r\ngovernment would give to those soldiers who had served in the French\r\nwar certain lands somewhere in the wild western country, Rufus Putnam\r\nwas selected as one of a party to find out where it would be well for\r\nthe people to settle.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the battle of Lexington been fought than Rufus Putnam was\r\namong the first to enlist; and it shows that he gained a good military\r\nreputation, for he was made lieutenant colonel of the first regiment\r\nraised in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COLONEL PUTNAM, THE ENGINEER\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of his knowledge of mathematics he was chosen by the leaders of\r\nthe American army to lay out the line of defenses round about Boston,\r\nand did more than a full share in forcing the British to evacuate that\r\ncity, because of the skill with which he established the fortifications\r\non Dorchester Heights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonel Putnam, the Engineer.]\r\n\r\nLater he was sent to New York, where he took charge of the defenses on\r\nLong Island at Fort Lee, and King\'s Bridge; and during the year when\r\nour people made their formal declaration of independence, Rufus Putnam\r\nwas appointed engineer, with the rank of colonel and pay at sixty\r\ndollars a month.\r\n\r\nThe next year Colonel Putnam went back to Massachusetts, where he\r\nraised and took command of a regiment which he afterward led in the\r\nbattle of Stillwater and again at Saratoga, covering himself with\r\nglory, so I have heard Parson Cutler say.\r\n\r\nAfter the surprise at Stony Point, Colonel Putnam was appointed to the\r\ncommand of a regiment in General Wayne\'s brigade, continuing to serve\r\nwith credit to himself, and to the best interests of his country, until\r\n1783, when Congress promoted him to the rank of brigadier general; he\r\nremained in the service of the people, filling one position or another,\r\nuntil this Ohio Company was formed, as I have told you.\r\n\r\nAnother matter which you should bear in mind while thinking of us so\r\nfar away, is that when Parson Cutler made the trade with the government\r\nfor land in the Ohio country, he induced the Congress to set aside two\r\nentire townships, of thirty-six square miles each, for the support of\r\na university, and in each of the other townships one square mile to be\r\nused solely for the support of schools and churches. Therefore, even\r\nbefore any man had begun the building of a home here on the Muskingum\r\nRiver, schools and churches were provided for, which is more, I\r\nbelieve, than can be said regarding most new settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FIRST EMIGRANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nYou remember all the talk and excitement in Massachusetts at this\r\ntime, when so much was being told regarding the beauties of the Ohio\r\ncountry, and you know how eager I was to set out with that first party\r\nwhich left Danvers under the leadership of Major Haffield White on the\r\nfirst day of December, in the year 1787.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Emigrants in a Conestoga Wagon.]\r\n\r\nAs you also know, these men were to halt somewhere on the Youghiogheny\r\nRiver to build boats, in order to continue the journey by water, and\r\na second party, under the command of General Putnam himself, was to\r\nleave Hartford in Connecticut shortly afterward, to join those from\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis second company was really led by Colonel Ebenezer Sproat because\r\nGeneral Putnam was forced to go to New York on some business of his\r\nown, and did not succeed in overtaking the people until they had come\r\nto Swatara Creek in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BUILDING A FLEET\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Haffield White\'s party arrived at Sumrill\'s Ferry, after a long\r\nand tedious journey over the old Military Road, on the twenty-third day\r\nof January, in the year 1788, and immediately began building boats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Campus Martius.]\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of February, General Putnam\'s party, by which I mean\r\nthose who set out from Hartford, joined those who were already at the\r\nferry, and the two companies landed here on the bank of the Muskingum\r\nRiver the seventh day of April, in the year 1788.\r\n\r\nAll this is an old and familiar story; but it is well for me to remind\r\nyou of it, so that you can the better understand how I, who had\r\nbelieved and hoped I was coming into a new country to do my full share\r\nin building up a town, found everything, as one might say, ready to\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nInstead of cutting through the wilderness in order to build houses, we\r\nfound the land so far cleared that we might get about the home making\r\nat once, and during the time the work was being carried on, the people\r\nlived in the fort, which General Putnam calls Campus Martius. It is\r\nsituated near Fort Harmar, a fortification standing on the west bank\r\nof the Muskingum River near its mouth, and not far from this town of\r\nMarietta. It was built in 1785, and Colonel Josiah Harmar is now in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CAMPUS MARTIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by Campus Martius, when I claim to be living in the\r\ntown of Marietta? When General Putnam and his company arrived here,\r\nthe first thing they did was to build a fort for the protection, not\r\nonly of themselves, but of those who might come after; concerning this\r\nfort I will tell you later, but first you may be, and probably are, as\r\ncurious as I was regarding the name.\r\n\r\nI asked General Putnam, and he told me it was named after a certain lot\r\nof land in the city of Rome, which was used for popular assemblies and\r\nmilitary exercises. However, the town itself is called Marietta, after\r\nMarie Antoinette of France, who was so brutally killed by her subjects\r\nduring the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Men building the Campus Martius fort.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better if I begin this story by telling you how we\r\ngot here, for the journey was not only long, but tiresome, and made at\r\nthe cost of much labor. But yet it seems best to set down all within\r\nmy knowledge concerning those men who first came out, meaning the\r\nparty which left Danvers in Massachusetts, and that which started from\r\nHartford in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nAll that I know about Major White\'s company during the march is\r\nthat they came over what is called the old Military Road, across\r\nPennsylvania, until they arrived at the Youghiogheny River, which they\r\ncrossed, and then went into winter quarters at Sumrill\'s Ferry.\r\n\r\nThere they set about building a flatboat, which they called the\r\n_Mayflower_, making her forty-six feet long and twelve feet wide, with\r\na roof deck and a sharp bow, to be propelled by either sails or oars;\r\nthey built also a smaller flatboat and several canoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Men Building a Flatboat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARRIVAL OF GENERAL PUTNAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was while they were building this fleet that General Putnam\'s\r\nparty joined them, and on the first day of April the new _Mayflower_,\r\ntogether with the smaller craft, began the voyage down the Ohio,\r\narriving opposite Fort Harmar on the seventh day of April. There were\r\nforty-eight men on board the vessels: four surveyors with twenty-two\r\nothers to attend them, six boat builders, four carpenters, one\r\nblacksmith, and eleven so-called common hands.\r\n\r\nI myself have heard General Putnam say that when his company arrived\r\nat Swatara Creek it was frozen over, but not sufficiently hard to\r\nbear the weight of the wagon, and they spent one entire day cutting a\r\npassage through the ice. Then, later, he says so great was the quantity\r\nof snow as to block up the roads, and when they got as far as Cooper\'s,\r\nat the foot of the Tuscarora mountains, they found old snow twelve\r\ninches deep. Nothing save pack horses had passed over it, therefore it\r\nwas necessary to build sleds and harness the animals one before the\r\nother, with the men marching in front to break out the roads, and thus\r\nthey continued until arriving at the Youghiogheny, as I have already\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Mayflower (Flatboat) Going Downriver.]\r\n\r\nAs you know, our town of Marietta is on the Muskingum River at its\r\nmouth where it empties into the Ohio, and I am sending you such a\r\ndrawing as I have been able to make, so that you may know just where we\r\nare located.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE WORK OF THE FIRST EMIGRANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost likely General Putnam decided upon this particular place in which\r\nto build a town because Fort Harmar, erected here in the year 1785,\r\nwould afford a very timely place of refuge in case the Indians made\r\nan attack upon our people before they were in condition to defend\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand Drawn Map of Marietta.]\r\n\r\nFort Harmar is on the lower bank of the river, while our town of\r\nMarietta is on the opposite side, or what might be called the upper\r\npoint of land between the Muskingum and the Ohio.\r\n\r\nAllen, who is a son of Captain Jonathan Devoll, and came with the first\r\nparty from Danvers, told me that as soon as our people landed they\r\nset about making huts of boards which had been brought with them from\r\nSumrill\'s Ferry, and at the same time put up a canvas tent for the\r\nuse of General Putnam, wherein he could transact the business of the\r\nnew colony, and in such shelters they lived until the fort had been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Men Reading the Laws Nailed to Tree by River.]\r\n\r\nThe surveyors immediately began laying out the town lots and the farms\r\nfor those people who had bought shares in the company, and many laws\r\nor regulations were made by General Putnam and his friends, which were\r\nnailed to the trunk of a large tree on the river bank where all might\r\nsee them.\r\n\r\nThe place was then, and is now, as beautiful a spot as one could well\r\nimagine. There are fish in the rivers in abundance, and game of every\r\nkind to be found in greatest plenty. Just fancy herds of buffaloes and\r\ndeer roaming through the forest and over the plains, while wild turkeys\r\nare found in such numbers as would do your heart good, especially after\r\na good plump one has been cooked on a spit in front of a roaring fire.\r\n\r\nThere was very little hunting done for sport, however, so Allen Devoll\r\ntold me. Those people who went out in search of game did so only that\r\nthey might provide themselves and their companions with food; for the\r\nwork on every hand was abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CLEARING THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nEnormous trees in the forest were to be girdled and thus killed\r\nthat they might the more easily be hewn down, and the soil had to\r\nbe prepared for planting. That these newcomers were not idle may be\r\nunderstood when I tell you that, during the first spring they were\r\nhere, one hundred and thirty acres of corn were planted.\r\n\r\nOf course there were no cleared fields, such as one might see about\r\nMattapoisett. The seed was put in among stumps, where only the\r\nunderbrush had been cleared away; therefore a plow could not be run to\r\nmake a straight furrow.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the work was done with hoes and spades; and\r\nalready I have had disagreeable experience in that kind of labor,\r\nwhich causes one\'s back to ache woefully and blisters the hands even of\r\nthose who are accustomed to such toil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man Using a Hoe in a Cornfield.]\r\n\r\nAnd now after all this, which is what you might call the beginning\r\nof my story, I will tell you of our leaving home, and of that long,\r\nwearisome journey across the mountains, when we forded creeks and, if\r\nyou please, might be said to have walked from one side of the state of\r\nPennsylvania to the other.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes regretted that I was not with the company led by Major\r\nWhite, or under the leadership of Colonel Sproat, so that I could say\r\nthat I was one of the first to step foot in this Ohio country with the\r\nidea of making a home; but those voyagers were only men who could\r\nperform such work as boat building or surveying, and boys were neither\r\nwanted nor allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOW OUR COMPANY WAS FORMED\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst you should know that Captain Jonathan Devoll was a member of the\r\ncompany that came here under the leadership of Major White, setting out\r\nfrom Danvers. He had left his family behind in Providence, and because\r\nof that fact perhaps, I was given an opportunity to come.\r\n\r\nHaving neither father nor mother, and being dependent upon those who\r\nwere willing to provide me with work whereby I might gain a livelihood,\r\nthere was no one to push forward my claim to become one of the\r\nemigrants, save only Mistress Devoll herself, who needed some one to\r\naid her in caring for the children during the journey, for she is not a\r\nvery strong woman.\r\n\r\nMaster John Rouse had bought a share in the company and was making\r\nready to start with his family, when he received word that he should\r\nbring with him all Captain Devoll\'s family. Then there was Captain\r\nHaskell in our town of Mattapoisett, an old sailor who owned a large\r\ncovered wagon and two horses.\r\n\r\nMaster Rouse had only one team of horses; therefore he proposed to\r\nCaptain Haskell that they join forces, and surely it was a good trade\r\nfor Master Rouse, since he had a large family to take with him, while\r\nthe old captain was alone in the world.\r\n\r\nBecause of the labor involved in driving four horses during so long a\r\ntime as would be required for the journey, it was decided that young\r\nBen Cushing should be hired as driver, and thus the party was made up,\r\nuntil Mistress Devoll so kindly interfered in my behalf, claiming that\r\nshe had a right to take with her at least one more lad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MAKING READY FOR THE JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish I could describe to you the excitement under which we all\r\nlabored while making ready for the long journey!\r\n\r\nDo you remember the Rouse family? First there is Michael, twenty-two\r\nyears old; then Bathsheba, who is nineteen or thereabouts; and\r\nElizabeth, two years younger. Cynthia is two years younger than\r\nElizabeth; Ruth is only eleven years old; Stephen, six, and the twins,\r\nRobert and Barker, only four.\r\n\r\nNow if Mistress Devoll had not needed my services, I should have found\r\nample opportunity of earning my way across to the Ohio country by\r\ntaking care of the Rouse children.\r\n\r\nThe most important matter was the preparing of the wagon, where the\r\nwomen would sleep during such nights as we failed to find lodgings in\r\ntaverns or farmhouses, and it was with infinite care that Master Rouse\r\nand Captain Haskell almost rebuilt this cart, which was what I believe\r\nis generally called a Conestoga wagon, although why it should be given\r\nsuch a name I do not understand, unless it may have been made in some\r\ntown by the name of Conestoga.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Men Packing the Conestoga Wagon.]\r\n\r\nWith so many in the company, you can fancy that it was a difficult\r\nmatter to decide just what should be taken and what left behind, for\r\nit was of the utmost importance that the baggage be reduced to the\r\nsmallest possible amount, and in order that it might be packed with the\r\ngreatest economy, boxes were made to fit exactly into the bottom of\r\nthe wagon, so that no space would be left unoccupied. On top of these\r\nwere stowed the beds and bedding, while cooking utensils hung around\r\non the inside, where we might get at them handily at mealtime, for,\r\nas it proved, very many days we were forced to do our cooking by the\r\nroadside, with such fireplaces as could be built up with rocks which we\r\nlads gathered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boys Preparing a Cooking Fire.]\r\n\r\nTwo trunks were placed at one end of the wagon, where they served as\r\na barrier to prevent the twins from falling out when they played on\r\nthe bedding, and upon the axles were hung buckets and such tools as\r\nmight be needed during the journey, thus giving the outfit a decidedly\r\ncomical, but perhaps homelike, appearance.\r\n\r\nWe took with us only a small amount of grain for the horses, trusting\r\nto buy all that might be needed until we had journeyed as far as\r\nCarlisle in Pennsylvania. After that there would be less chance of\r\ncoming upon farms where such things could be purchased, and then the\r\nanimals would be forced to subsist only on grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONCERNING MYSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nMy part of the outfit consisted of the clothes I wore, for I am\r\nashamed to say that I did not own a second coat which would have been\r\npresentable in any company. Therefore I did not allow myself to be\r\ntroubled when the women complained long and bitterly because they had\r\nso little with which to work or make themselves comfortable, and for\r\nthe only time in my life it did seem as if my poverty was really a\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nI lived in a perfect fever of excitement during the three weeks we were\r\nmaking ready for the voyage, and on the evening before the eventful day\r\nI was so wrought up in my mind that to sleep was an impossibility. From\r\nthe time I laid myself down on my bed in Master Rouse\'s stable, until\r\nthe sun rose, I did not close my eyes in slumber; then I acted as if I\r\nhad never seen a horse or harness before, for when Ben Cushing called\r\non me to aid him in putting the animals to the pole, my hands trembled\r\nso that I could not fasten a buckle, let alone arrange the straps to\r\nhis liking.\r\n\r\nBen is a careful driver and one who ever looks after the welfare of his\r\nbeasts. To him a strap too long or too short, a buckle out of place or\r\nliable to break, is almost the same as a sin.\r\n\r\nI need not have allowed myself to be worked up to such an extent,\r\nhowever, for the first part of our journey was nothing more nor less\r\nthan pleasure. Half a dozen young girls, on horseback, set off with\r\nus, expecting to ride as far as the Long Plain, which is six miles out\r\nfrom Mattapoisett, and the entire population, as it appeared to me,\r\nhad turned out to see us get under way with that long Conestoga wagon\r\ncovered with canvas, on the sides of which had been painted, "To the\r\nOhio Country."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group Setting Out on the Trail.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SETTING OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a cheering and shaking of hands, and what a showering of good\r\nwishes upon us took place in that Mattapoisett street!\r\n\r\nIf we could have had Parson Cutler with us to give what you might call\r\nan official sanction to the start, as was done when Major White\'s\r\nparty set off from Danvers, then I would have been more content.\r\nSurely, however, there was no need for me to make complaint, because\r\nnever before had I witnessed such a scene of excitement as when Ben\r\nCushing gathered up the reins, and the townspeople stood around the\r\nheavy wagon until Mistress Rouse cried out in alarm lest some of them\r\nbe run over. The twins, insisting on going the first mile or more\r\nafoot, ran here and there until it seemed to me at times that they were\r\nunder the very feet of the horses during three minutes of every four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Children in the Conestoga Wagon.]\r\n\r\nIt was really a relief, when we had drawn out of the town so far\r\nthat the more excited ones could no longer call out to say once more\r\n"good-by" or "God bless you." I ought not to have been so impatient,\r\nfor many a long day was to pass before I again saw faces on which I\r\ncould read expressions of good will and friendliness toward me.\r\n\r\nThis first portion of our journey was quite like a merrymaking. The\r\nyoung women rode either side the wagon; the Rouse girls walked, or sat\r\nbeside their mother in the big cart, as pleased them best, and the\r\ntwins, soon tiring of striving to entangle themselves with the horses\'\r\nlegs, were ready to come in under the shelter of the canvas.\r\n\r\nWe drove only six miles, and indeed this was quite a journey for\r\nthe first day, because the animals were not accustomed to traveling\r\ntogether and gave Ben Cushing no little trouble. Besides, our departure\r\nhad been delayed so long, owing to the townspeople, that it was nearly\r\nnoon before we had left Mattapoisett behind us, and the day was nearly\r\ndone when we had come to the Long Plain, and there stopped at the home\r\nof Mistress Devoll\'s cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MISTRESS DEVOLL\'S OUTFIT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had but one wagon for all our party from the time we left\r\nMattapoisett until coming to Providence. Mistress Devoll and Mistress\r\nRouse are sisters and were much together at Mattapoisett after Captain\r\nDevoll set off for the Ohio country. It was while the captain\'s wife\r\nwas in our village that she made me the offer to pay my passage to the\r\nMuskingum River by looking after her belongings.\r\n\r\nMistress Devoll expected to join Master Rouse\'s company at her home in\r\nProvidence, where she was to have ready a wagon in which would be all\r\nher household goods that could be transported over the mountains. She\r\nwas to have a team of four horses, and her brother, Isaac Barker, was\r\nto act as driver, while I played the part of helper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ben Cushing Driving a Wagon with Benjamin Beside Him.]\r\n\r\nTherefore on leaving Mattapoisett I ran ahead or behind Master Rouse\'s\r\nwagon, or clambered up by the side of Ben Cushing when the seat next\r\nto him was not occupied, for he was a good friend of mine and could be\r\ncounted on to give me a hint now and then, if I overstepped my bounds.\r\n\r\nThe stay at the Long Plain overnight was what you might call a friendly\r\nvisit for all the members of the company save Ben Cushing and me;\r\nbut we two were not lonely, for we laid ourselves down to sleep in\r\nthe wagon, after having had a bountiful meal at the home of Mistress\r\nDevoll\'s cousin, and it is safe to say that during the first night\r\nafter starting for the Ohio country we slept more comfortably, if not\r\nmore soundly, than on any other during the journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ben Cushing and Benjamin Sleeping in the Wagon.]\r\n\r\nWe were up at break of day, however, for the horses were to be groomed\r\nand fed, and Master Rouse had decided that we must travel as far as\r\nProvidence before nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe young women who had come out from Mattapoisett with us, went back\r\nsome time late in the evening after Cushing and I were asleep, and when\r\nbreakfast had been eaten we set off once more, just as the sun was\r\nrising. It seemed as if this was really the beginning of the journey,\r\nfor we were alone, plodding over the dusty road which, to look into\r\nthe future, seemed as if it would have no end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AT PROVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour after sunset we halted in front of Mistress Devoll\'s house.\r\nThe horses were unhitched and taken to a stable, where Ben and I were\r\nspeedily joined by Isaac Barker, whom we had seen more than once in\r\nMattapoisett, and we three, while caring for the animals, discussed at\r\ngreat length the undertaking which lay all before us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boys Pushing the Wagon up a Mountain Road.]\r\n\r\nA rare hand at making sport was Isaac Barker, and many a time after\r\nleaving Providence it did seem to me that but for his quips and jokes\r\nwe might have given up in despair at trying to gain this country, for\r\nthe way was hard over the best of the roads we found, and there were\r\nmany moments, after we got into Pennsylvania, when all the members\r\nof the company were forced to lay hold of ropes tied to the tops of\r\nthe carts to prevent them from oversetting. Then it was that Isaac\'s\r\nnonsense really served to hearten us.\r\n\r\nYou can well fancy that when we were once among the mountains the way\r\nwas exceedingly hard to travel, and again and again I have laid my\r\nshoulder against the hind end of one of the wagons, straining every\r\nmuscle to help the horses on, while every other man and boy was doing\r\nthe same, and doing it to the utmost of his power.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in leaving Providence next morning. Mistress Devoll\'s\r\nwagon was packed and ready, and after eating a breakfast which had been\r\nprepared by some of the neighbors, we set off, I walking with the men\r\neither ahead or behind the teams, for there was not sufficient room in\r\nboth wagons for all our company to ride. There are five of the Devoll\r\nchildren: Sally, twelve years old; Henry, two years younger; Charles,\r\naged eight; Barker, five; and Francis, a baby not much more than a year\r\nold.\r\n\r\nIsaac Barker cracked jokes as he swung the whip over the backs of\r\nthe horses; the Rouse girls sang until they were hoarse; the smaller\r\nchildren screamed with delight because we were finally on our way to\r\nthe wilderness; and everything went on as if we were still simply bent\r\nupon pleasure during this third day of the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ON THE ROAD TO BLOOMING GROVE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is not in my mind to set down an account of every day\'s journey\r\nwhile we were in what you might call civilized country, for we simply\r\ndrove the horses as far as we could each day, with due care to a\r\nresting place at night, passing through Farmington, Litchfield, and\r\nBallsbridge, to the Hudson River.\r\n\r\nOf course it was necessary to cross the water, and to do this, Master\r\nRouse and Captain Haskell hired two large boats into which we could\r\nstow the wagons as well as the horses. By the aid of both sails and\r\noars the clumsy craft were navigated from Fishkill to Newburgh, where\r\nwe took to the road again, traveling ten miles to a village called\r\nBlooming Grove. There we stopped at a tavern kept by a man named\r\nGoldsmith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin Cleaning Horses Hooves and Talking to Goldsmith.]\r\n\r\nThere is no particular reason why I should have remembered that man\'s\r\nname so long, had it not been that seeing me rubbing the legs of\r\nMistress Devoll\'s horses, on that evening, he took me kindly by the ear\r\nand said that I was a likely looking lad such as he stood in need of\r\nto help him about the tavern, proposing, if I would remain with him,\r\nto give me my board and clothes during the first year, allowing me to\r\nattend school meanwhile, at the same time promising that when such term\r\nof service had expired he would make another bargain, which should\r\ninclude a certain sum of money as wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PLANS FOR THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might have been better for me had I accepted the good man\'s\r\noffer, and yet there was in my mind such a desire to go out into that\r\nOhio country where even the poorest lad, if he was willing to work to\r\nthe best of his ability, could make a home for himself, that I could\r\nnot bring myself to think of remaining at the tavern doing chores for\r\nthis farmer or that, and getting no farther ahead in the world.\r\n\r\nAll of which I told him, and when I had come to an end of my talk, he\r\nreplied that he could not blame me for holding to the choice I had\r\nmade, and said he hoped it might be possible for me to do all that was\r\nin my mind. At the same time he assured me that if I found this part of\r\nthe country different from what I had fancied, and was ready to come\r\nback into civilization, where I might have the comforts of home, I\r\nshould present myself to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ferryman and Captain Haskell.]\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not advanced so far in the world as I had hoped might\r\nhave been possible, I have not fallen in the race of life. I am no\r\nworse off than when I landed here at Marietta, and have laid up for\r\nmyself some few dollars, in addition to the knowledge that I am of\r\nservice in the settlement; therefore I cannot regret the choice I made\r\nat Blooming Grove.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving that village we journeyed over good roads through the\r\ntowns of Chester and Warwick, finally crossing the state line into New\r\nJersey, and coming to the town of Newton.\r\n\r\nWe had neither adventure nor mishap during this portion of our\r\ntravels, for the roads were good, the horses inclined to move at a\r\nreasonably rapid pace, and those who would have walked from choice\r\nfound themselves speedily distanced. More than once were Master Rouse,\r\nCaptain Haskell, and I so far behind the wagons that the drivers\r\nbelieved it necessary to halt in order that we might join the company.\r\n\r\nFrom Newton we went past Sussex Court House, or the Log Jail as it is\r\ncalled, through the towns of Hope and Oxford, to the village of Easton,\r\nwhich is situated at the forks of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ON THE WATER ONCE MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we were forced to take to the water once more, in order that we\r\nmight cross over into the state of Pennsylvania, and because there was\r\nbut one flatboat to be hired at this place, no little time was spent in\r\nmaking the passage.\r\n\r\nIt was near nightfall when we were safely landed on the Pennsylvania\r\nshore, and then came the question as to where we might spend the night.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman had told Captain Haskell that five miles down the\r\nroad was a farm owned by an old German who was disposed to care for\r\ntravelers who were well-behaved and willing to pay a certain small sum\r\nfor the service he rendered. We therefore hastened our pace, moving as\r\nrapidly as possible, until, half an hour after the sun had set, we came\r\nto a farm, the buildings of which would have delighted the eyes of any\r\nman who had a care for such things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eating Buckwheat Cakes at the German Farmer\'s House.]\r\n\r\nSurely no one could have been more hospitable than were the old German\r\nand his wife, to say nothing of the four sons and three daughters, all\r\nof whom made us welcome and insisted that we come into their kitchen\r\nto eat supper with them, rather than make any attempt at providing\r\nour own meals, as we had been doing nearly all the time since leaving\r\nMattapoisett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FEASTING ON HONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Ben Cushing and I did eat that night! The owner of the farm had\r\ngiven especial attention to the raising of bees and had a large store\r\nof honey on hand. The farmer\'s wife and daughters baked such cakes of\r\nbuckwheat as I never before tasted, and these, plentifully covered with\r\nthe golden honey, made up a meal which still lingers in my memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Among the Moravians in Bethlehem.]\r\n\r\nWe passed the night there, all the company except Ben Cushing, Isaac\r\nBarker, and me, sleeping on the floor of the kitchen and living room,\r\nwhere beds had been spread for their comfort.\r\n\r\nCaptain Haskell showed how a sailor could take advantage of every inch\r\nof space, for when the women claimed that there was not room in which\r\nto make up beds for all and dispose of their clothing properly during\r\nthe hours of the night, the captain turned down the chairs so that the\r\nbacks of them would serve as heads for the beds, thus making pillows,\r\nand pointed out that the spaces underneath could be filled with the\r\nclothing where it might be found readily in the morning.\r\n\r\nBen, Isaac, and I found snug resting places for ourselves in the\r\nsweet-smelling hay on the mow, and slept, I dare say, quite as soundly\r\nand sweetly as did those who were sheltered in the house.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, that is to say, when there was the first evidence of\r\nthe dawning of a new day, we three set about making ready the horses\r\nfor the journey, and were no sooner come to an end of our labors than\r\nwe were summoned by one of the girls to the kitchen, where, the beds\r\nhaving been removed from the floor, a table was spread most bountifully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AMONG THE MORAVIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girls Coming Home from School.]\r\n\r\nThe next day of our journey was most entertaining, at least so it\r\nseemed to me, for we came to the town of Bethlehem, which is settled\r\nalmost entirely by those ardent Christian men and women who are known\r\nas Moravians and who have already sent out missionaries among the\r\nIndians, doing no small amount of good.\r\n\r\nThose Moravian people were exceedingly hospitable, urging us to partake\r\nof food in their houses, insisting on feeding our horses, and allowing\r\nus to wander wheresoever we would.\r\n\r\nIndeed there was much to be seen in their town, for at one of the\r\nhouses was a pet bear which was most amusing, and the smaller children,\r\nas well as Ben Cushing and I, spent more than an hour watching the\r\nlittle fellow\'s clumsy, and at the same time comical, antics. There\r\nwere also a number of pet deer wandering about the streets, and when we\r\nhad fed them with clover, to our heart\'s content, we were delighted at\r\nseeing a large throng of little girls coming from school, dressed in\r\nwhat was to me a most singular fashion, although not unbecoming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rope Ferry.]\r\n\r\nThey all wore short gowns with gayly-colored petticoats, which came\r\nan inch or two below the frock itself, and had small, white linen\r\ncaps which caused them to look much like old ladies. Prim and demure\r\nthey were while marching in an orderly manner through the streets,\r\nand yet I saw more than one cast a sidelong glance toward our company\r\nof children, with a twinkle in their eyes as token that, were they so\r\npermitted, they could show us that they had in their natures quite as\r\nmuch love for fun as any other boy or girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ROPE FERRY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stayed longer in Bethlehem than we were warranted in doing, when\r\none takes into consideration the length of the journey before us; but\r\nit was all so entertaining, so peaceful, and there was such an air\r\nof friendliness among the people, that I was sorry when we drove out\r\nof the town, hoping to find lodgings for the night at the house of a\r\nGerman, eight miles beyond.\r\n\r\nAnd so we journeyed on without adventure until we came to the Lehigh\r\nRiver, and there I saw what I dare say no fellow in Massachusetts has\r\nlaid eyes upon. It was called a rope ferry, by means of which we were\r\nto cross the river.\r\n\r\nBen Cushing claims that there is nothing wonderful about this ferry,\r\nfor it consists simply of a rope stretched from one bank of the river\r\nto the other; to this, attached by a noose, or, in other words, a\r\nhawser which will readily slip, the ferryboat is made fast in such a\r\nmanner that the stern is lower downstream than the bow, and the current\r\ncatching this, forces the boat along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buying Needed Item from Farmers.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps I haven\'t made this very plain to you, but it is operated on\r\nthe principle of force applied to what might be called an inclined\r\nplane; therefore, since the craft cannot be shoved downstream by the\r\ncurrent, it must be urged toward the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nAt all events to me it was a great curiosity, whether Ben Cushing\r\nthought it so or not, and I studied the general arrangement so\r\ncarefully that if we should need anything of the kind in this country,\r\nI am quite certain I could build one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE WAY THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNow our way lay through Allentown and Kutztown to Reading; the roads\r\nover which we traveled were so good, and the horses so willing, that\r\nevery member of our company enjoyed himself to the utmost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German Women Swingling Flax.]\r\n\r\nCynthia Rouse and Sally Devoll visited back and forth from wagon to\r\nwagon during each day, their favorite seat being with the driver, where\r\nthey could see what was going on and sing to their heart\'s content.\r\n\r\nWe were treated kindly by the people, who sold us bread and butter,\r\nmilk or meat, and now and then we came to a store or tavern where we\r\ncould lay in additional supplies of provisions, but, as a rule, thus\r\nfar we had found it possible to buy from farmers all that we might need.\r\n\r\nAt night, when we were stopping at a farmhouse, and after the small\r\nchildren had been put to bed, the older girls would set about\r\npreparing provisions for the next day, perhaps borrowing cooking\r\nutensils, for our own were few in number and fitted rather for use on a\r\nrough fireplace out of doors than in a well-ordered kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt had become the rule that Isaac Barker, Ben Cushing, and I were to\r\nsleep in the wagons during the night to guard against the possibility\r\nof evil-disposed persons. Up to this time, however, we had had no\r\ntrouble of the kind; but Captain Haskell insisted that we remain\r\nconstantly on our guard, claiming that the day might come when we would\r\nfall in with people not so friendly as those who had thus far cheered\r\nus on our way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SHAME OF THE GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day when we went into Reading, Cynthia Rouse and Sally Devoll\r\nwere on the front seat of Isaac\'s wagon, and as they rode along the\r\ngirls saw two old German women swingling, or as they called it,\r\n"scutchelling" flax.\r\n\r\nThe old ladies presented a most comical appearance, and the girls\r\nlaughed loudly, never thinking for a moment that they were being rude;\r\nbut when the flax swinglers looked up angrily and saw the legend on our\r\nwagon cover, one of them shouted to the girls that if they were going\r\ninto the Ohio country, the day would soon come when they also would be\r\nswingling flax, if they did their duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, this caused the girls no little shame, for being\r\nthus reproved by their elders was not pleasant, more particularly when\r\nthey knew they had been guilty of rudeness.\r\n\r\nThis town of Reading was the most considerable place we had seen\r\nsince leaving Massachusetts, and Master Rouse decided that we should\r\nremain there at least one day because of the number of shops where we\r\ncould buy such articles as were needed, or otherwise put ourselves in\r\nreadiness for the rougher journey which we knew lay before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MEETING WITH PARSON CUTLER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was owing to this decision that we got late and trustworthy news\r\nconcerning the land where we counted on making our homes, for there we\r\nmet Parson Cutler himself.\r\n\r\nI despair of making you understand how surprised and delighted we were\r\nat meeting the parson midway in our journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parson Cutler in His Sulky.]\r\n\r\nWe all knew that during the summer he had set out in his sulky\r\nintending to drive from Ipswich to Marietta; but since we did not leave\r\nuntil October, we supposed, if indeed we gave very much heed to the\r\nmatter, that Master Cutler must have returned long ere this.\r\n\r\nThe parson appeared quite as well pleased to see us as we were to see\r\nhim, and straightway commended Master Rouse and Captain Haskell upon\r\ntheir spirit in thus going out into the Ohio country, where he assured\r\nthem they would find such farming lands as had never been seen in\r\nMassachusetts. In addition to this, he set Mistress Devoll\'s mind at\r\nrest regarding her husband and spent no little time explaining to her\r\nwhat the captain had done in the way of building the _Mayflower_ and\r\nthe other boats which carried the first settlers down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OHIO CORNFIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other things, he told us of the enormous fields of corn which\r\nhad been planted, described to us the cabins our people had built,\r\nwhich were little more than low huts covered in with walnut bark, and\r\ndeclared that the houses and the corn seemed to grow at the same time,\r\nalthough the corn speedily overshadowed the small dwellings, for it\r\ngrew so tall that one had to stand on tiptoes to break off an ear,\r\nwhile in Massachusetts it was often necessary for a farmer to stoop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ohio Cornfields.]\r\n\r\n"One could as easily be lost in a cornfield on a cloudy day as in a\r\ncedar swamp," Parson Cutler said, and then went on to tell how much\r\nlike a forest were these fields, where the green grain grew above one\'s\r\nhead with leaves so huge as to shut out all rays of light from one\r\nfurrow to another.\r\n\r\nHe rather dampened the ardor of some of the women when he said that the\r\nsurveyors were forced to do their work under the protection of a guard\r\nof armed men, for fear of prowling Indians, and the children looked\r\nat each other in alarm as he told of one of the settlers who had been\r\nbitten, when asleep, by a copperhead snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GOVERNOR AND JUDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe heard also from Parson Cutler that General Arthur St. Clair had\r\nbeen appointed governor of the Ohio district. He was a citizen of\r\nPennsylvania, had been a distinguished officer in the Revolutionary\r\narmy, and president of Congress, in addition to which he stood high\r\nin the confidence of Washington. Samuel H. Parsons of Connecticut,\r\nand James M. Varnum of Massachusetts, both of whom were directors in\r\nthe Ohio Company, and John Cleves Symmes of New Jersey had been made\r\njudges, with Winthrop Sargent of New Hampshire as secretary of the\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe judges arrived at Marietta in June, and on the 9th of July,\r\nGovernor St. Clair joined them. He was escorted by a detachment of\r\ntroops under Major Doughty, who had gone up to Pittsburgh from Fort\r\nHarmar some days before to meet him, and was received with military\r\nhonors and a salute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Governor greeted with rounds from fieldpiece.]\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers afterward told me that when the governor landed he\r\nwas greeted with thirteen rounds from a fieldpiece. When he approached\r\nthe garrison, the music played a salute, the troops paraded and\r\npresented their arms, and he was also welcomed by a clap of thunder\r\nand a heavy shower of rain as he entered the fort. It seemed to\r\nthis soldier a very pleasant way of receiving the governor of a new\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, Parson Cutler was enthusiastic in his\r\npraise of our town of Marietta, and he read to us that which General\r\nWashington himself had written, which was this:--\r\n\r\n"No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as\r\nthat which has just commenced at the Muskingum. Information, property,\r\nand strength will be its characteristics. I know many of the settlers\r\npersonally, and there never were men better calculated to promote the\r\nwelfare of such a community."\r\n\r\nThere was little need for Parson Cutler to try to strengthen us in\r\nthe determination to continue the journey, for none of our party were\r\nweak-kneed; but it pleased us much to know that such a man as General\r\nWashington could praise so heartily those who had begun the building of\r\nMarietta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE NAME OF THE TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, lest I forget it, and since it is brought to my mind by what\r\nParson Cutler said to us, let me tell you that this town came very near\r\nbeing named Adelphia. It was the Parson\'s idea, and he said much to us\r\nconcerning it, complaining, as I thought, because it had been called\r\nMarietta. The meaning of Adelphia is "brethren," so he said, and he\r\nclaimed that by having constantly before them the idea that they were\r\nto dwell there as brethren, the people might be more inclined to act as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nLater, when he had gone, I heard Master Rouse and Captain Haskell\r\ndiscussing the matter, and both allowed that the good parson was really\r\nirritated because his suggestion had been cast aside, for one could\r\nreadily see that Master Cutler had set his mind stoutly upon the name\r\nAdelphia. In my opinion, however, Marietta is much better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four deer eating ripe grapes in Muskingum bottom.]\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Parson Cutler told us that game was so plentiful\r\neven close about Marietta, that we need have no fear of ever being\r\nhungry. He said that in the course of a walk one morning up the\r\nMuskingum bottom he saw four deer, and there were ripe grapes hanging\r\nin profusion all around him. In addition to that, he found clam beds on\r\nthe shores, and, what was not quite so pleasant, killed a rattlesnake\r\nthat lay coiled up in his path.\r\n\r\nI don\'t claim to be timorous under ordinary circumstances, and am ready\r\nto stand my chances against Indians or bears; but when it comes to\r\nsnakes, I must say that there is a bit of cowardice in me, for a fellow\r\ncan\'t guard himself against such enemies, and it seems to me that they,\r\nwith the savages, make up the disagreeable features in all the pictures\r\nthat were drawn for us of our new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CAMPUS MARTIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow listen to this description which Parson Cutler gave us of Campus\r\nMartius, and I have since come to know that he did not set forth its\r\ncharacteristics any too strongly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Campus Maritius.]\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of house, or castle, if you please, instead of a regular\r\nfort, made in the form of a hollow square, of which the sides measure\r\none hundred and eighty feet, and is surrounded by a heavy line of\r\npalisades,--meaning a high log fence,--as protection against, the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThis building contains seventy-two rooms, each eighteen feet square or\r\nmore, and General Putnam had told the Parson that in case of necessity\r\nnine hundred people could live within its walls.\r\n\r\nSurely it seems like a city of itself, when one attempts to go from end\r\nto end inside the broad passages, and sees the doors leading to rooms\r\nin which an entire family might contrive to live with more or less\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nParson Cutler was twenty-nine days driving from Ipswich to Marietta in\r\nhis sulky, so he told us; but do not understand that such a journey may\r\nalways be made in so short a time. He took advantage of the best season\r\nof the year in which to make the trip, and returned before the snow\r\ncame; consequently, and because of traveling without very much baggage,\r\nand with a stout horse to draw his light sulky, he could make many more\r\nmiles in a day than could such wagons as ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INDEPENDENCE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nHe told us of the Fourth of July celebration, which was held in\r\nMarietta on that first Independence Day after the settlers arrived\r\nthere. They set about making a feast, and verily it must have been one.\r\nThere were venison barbecues,--meaning deer roasted whole,--buffalo\r\nsteaks broiled over the glowing coals, bear meat cooked in every manner\r\nthat could be devised with the few cooking implements our people\r\npossessed, small pigs roasted whole, and, as the greatest delicacy of\r\nall, an enormous pike, more than six feet long, said to be the largest\r\never caught in the Ohio River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe feast was kept up until twelve o\'clock at night, and then the tired\r\nmerrymakers went to their cabins and slept until late in the forenoon,\r\nas the parson said, in such a tone as if he believed they were wasting\r\ntheir time by thus remaining in bed after the sun had risen.\r\n\r\nThen came, according to Parson Cutler\'s story, at a later date, the\r\nopening of the first court in the territory, and it must have been a\r\nwondrous spectacle. The sheriff, who, as you know, is Colonel Ebenezer\r\nSproat, holding a drawn sword in his hand, marched with a military\r\nescort, ahead of the governor, the judges, the secretary, and others,\r\nto Campus Martius, where the court was held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are Indians in plenty about Marietta, and Parson Cutler said that\r\nwhen these savages saw Colonel Sproat, who as you know is an unusually\r\ntall man, they at once gave him the name of Hetuck, or Big Buckeye,\r\nwhich was the same as if they had called him one of the huge trees of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MASTER DEVOLL\'S HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was the growth of our town of Marietta the only thing concerning\r\nwhich the good man told us, for he gladdened Mistress Devoll\'s heart by\r\ndescribing to her the house her husband was building, which was to be\r\nforty feet long by eighteen feet wide, and the height of two stories.\r\n\r\nBest of all, there was to be a brick chimney, perhaps more than one,\r\nas soon as a kiln had been made and the bricks burned. It was to be by\r\nfar the largest building, with the exception of Campus Martius, in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE INDIAN MOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nParson Cutler told us during that night, when we sat around him at\r\nReading, about queer-shaped mounds of earth in various forms, which\r\nhad evidently been thrown up many hundred years before, perhaps by the\r\nIndians, perhaps by some race of people regarding whom we know nothing;\r\nbut certain it is there were very many about Marietta. In fact, Campus\r\nMartius was built on one of these mounds.\r\n\r\nThese embankments, as they might really be called, are of various\r\nshapes, some like serpents, many, many hundred feet long and I can\'t\r\nsay how many feet high, and of such huge proportions that they may be\r\nseen from a long distance. There is one, we were told, shaped something\r\nafter the fashion of an elephant; others are formed in circles, and\r\nstill others appear to have been made for fortifications.\r\n\r\nWhen we went to bed that night Ben Cushing and I talked until well past\r\nmidnight concerning what these things might have been, and he announced\r\nthat it was his intention to dig beneath them, believing there he\r\nwould find much in the way of treasure; but when he saw the enormous\r\nembankments, he soon realized that neither one man nor twenty could\r\nmake much headway digging beneath them.\r\n\r\nI heard General Putnam say it was his belief these mounds had something\r\nto do with the religious ceremonies of those who had built them; that\r\nthey had a certain significance in the worship of the Great Spirit; but\r\nas for there being treasure beneath them, he laughed at the idea.\r\n\r\nIf I should set down all Parson Cutler told us on that night concerning\r\nthe country to which we were going, I might never get further in my\r\nstory, for the good man talked long and fast, describing so many things\r\nof interest, such as the trapping of turkeys, the hunting of bears,\r\nand the different methods of killing deer, that my hair would be gray\r\nbefore I could write it all out fairly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of attempting to repeat his stories, I will go on\r\nwith my tale of how we journeyed from Massachusetts into the Ohio\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AT HARRISBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was near the close of October when we arrived at the Susquehanna\r\nRiver, at a settlement called Harrisburg, and a very slovenly looking\r\ntown it was, as I thought, for those who built it, only two years\r\nbefore, had thus far not taken the trouble to uproot the stumps of\r\ntrees which still stood in the roadways and gave the entire place a\r\nwild, neglected appearance.\r\n\r\nI was told that the settlement had formerly been called Louisburg, and\r\nthe only reason I can think of for the change of name is that there can\r\nbe found a ferry in charge of a man named Harris, and before any houses\r\nwere built near by it was known as Harris\'s Ferry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe remained at this place all night, the women and children going into\r\na log tavern to sleep, while we men and boys made our beds in the\r\nwagons, or on the hay in the stable, as best pleased us.\r\n\r\nBecause of not caring to spend so much money as would be necessary to\r\nbuy a supper for all our company, only the women and small children\r\npartook of the tavern fare, the older girls, the men, and we boys\r\neating our meals in the tavern yard, after having cooked them in the\r\ntavern kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe next day\'s journey was only thirteen miles, and then we arrived at\r\nCarlisle, which was a military station during our war for independence,\r\nand where were yet to be found barracks made of bricks, like regular\r\nhouses. There were two or three shops, and a number of good dwellings,\r\nbetter than one would expect to find even in a town that had been\r\nsettled so long.\r\n\r\nBecause we had not been fed overabundantly since leaving that farmhouse\r\nwhere we feasted on buckwheat cakes, Master Rouse decided that we\r\nshould all have dinner at the tavern, and a bountiful meal it was,\r\nalthough not quite so satisfactory to me as I could have wished,\r\nbecause of the fact that just then Isaac Barker took it into his head\r\nto play what he considered a funny trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ISAAC BARKER\'S SPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a huge platter of meat was being brought on the table, and we were\r\nall looking at it with most pleasant anticipations, for it appeared to\r\nhave been cooked to a turn, Isaac seized the dish in both hands, ran\r\nout of the room as if intending to eat it all himself, and the older\r\ngirls followed him, racing around and around the building with shouts\r\nof mirth, while the tavern keeper and his wife looked on in amazement,\r\nuntil Isaac tired of running.\r\n\r\nThen he replaced the meat on the table; but by this time it had grown\r\ncold, and instead of having hot venison steak, we were forced to\r\neat lukewarm meat, and it is not needed that I should say anything\r\nconcerning the disagreeable flavor of deer flesh when it has been kept\r\ntoo long from the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are times when one really wearies of Isaac\'s sport, and, as Ben\r\nCushing said when we drove away from Carlisle, a little fun now and\r\nthen is relished by the saddest of men; but when one keeps it up from\r\nmorning until night, and again from night until morning, it grows\r\nwearisome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          UNCLE DANIEL CARTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we left Carlisle it was to journey to a settlement called Big\r\nSprings, where, much to our surprise and delight, we came upon Uncle\r\nDaniel Carter with his three yoke of oxen hitched to a Conestoga\r\nwagon, and having as a load all Uncle Daniel\'s household goods as well\r\nas his family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel was an old acquaintance of ours, for he lived but a few\r\nmiles from Mattapoisett and had started for Ohio some two weeks before\r\nwe left home.\r\n\r\nThere had been no expectation in our minds that we should meet him on\r\nthe journey, for it was believed that, moving as slowly as he must with\r\nhis ox team, he, if not his wife, would grow weary of attempting to\r\ngain the Ohio country, and turn off at some inviting-looking point long\r\nbefore having arrived thus far in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBut the old man was not made of such stuff; he had set out to join\r\nRufus Putnam\'s company at Marietta, and declared that he would continue\r\non if it took a year to make the trip.\r\n\r\nWhat a meeting that was with the old man and his family! It was like\r\ncoming upon Mattapoisett suddenly. I had never before realized how much\r\naffection one may unwittingly have for his neighbors, until we saw\r\nUncle Daniel outside the log hut where he had stopped for the night,\r\nwatching us with an odd expression on his face as if doubting whether\r\nwe should recognize him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    UNCLE DANIEL JOINS OUR COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nMistress Carter insisted that she and her two daughters prepare the\r\nevening meal for all our company, and it seemed much as if we were\r\ndoing her the greatest favor, when we consented joyfully to share what\r\nwe had every reason to believe was a goodly portion of Uncle Daniel\'s\r\nscanty store of food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ended, Isaac and Ben Cushing built a lively fire\r\noutside the hut, for the night was chilly, and with the children\r\nwrapped in their warmest garments, all of us sat, or stretched out at\r\nfull length, around the cheering blaze, listening to Uncle Daniel\'s\r\nstory of his journey, or telling him of that which had happened to us\r\nsince we left home.\r\n\r\nBefore we crawled into the wagons that night it was decided, and\r\nwithout any controversy, that Uncle Daniel should join our company, the\r\nonly question being as to whether the horses would not travel so much\r\nfaster than his oxen that we could not well keep together.\r\n\r\nThe old man put an end to any speculation of that kind, however, by\r\ndeclaring that when night came we should find him not far behind us,\r\nand he laid plans for the journey of future days, by saying that we\r\nwere to give no heed whatsoever to him in the morning; he would feed\r\nhis cattle and be off, most-like before break of day.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be on hand when it\'s time for supper, an\' don\'t make any mistake\r\nabout that part of it," he said cheerily. "I\'m willin\' to agree that\r\nmy creeters can\'t walk as fast as your horses; but they can keep it\r\nup a good while longer, an\' you\'ll find it\'s the slow an\' steady that\r\ncomes out ahead in the long run. So look for your Uncle Daniel before\r\nsunset, an\' if he fails to show up, then you can set it down as a fact\r\nthat his wagon has gone to smash, or the oxen have turned tail for\r\nMassachusetts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HARD TRAVELING\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Ben Cushing would have it that we had come upon bad\r\nluck in meeting Uncle Daniel, for at daybreak the rain came down in\r\ntorrents, and speedily the roads, which were none of the best even in\r\ndry weather, became like quagmires. Before we were well on our way the\r\nwheels of the heavy wagons sank deep in the mud; the women were forced\r\nto remain under the covers or withstand the pelting of the rain, and we\r\nmen, who walked alongside in order to help the horses with their loads,\r\nwere speedily drenched to the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMistress Devoll would have insisted that we turn back and remain at\r\nthe log shanty until the rain ceased; but both Captain Haskell and\r\nMaster Rouse put an end to any such proposition by saying that now had\r\ncome the season when we might rightly expect storms, and if we were to\r\ndelay our journey save at such times as the weather was fair, winter\r\nwould overtake us among the mountains where we might find it impossible\r\neither to go ahead or to retreat.\r\n\r\nTherefore we plodded on, and instead of overtaking Uncle Daniel, as\r\nBen Cushing had predicted we should, before noon, we saw nothing of\r\nhim until night came. Then there was no bad luck in having a cheery\r\nblaze in the fireplace of a log tavern, and every arrangement possible\r\nmade for our comfort, to all of which the old man had attended before\r\nlooking after his own comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MUD AND WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me as if the rain fell incessantly, and you can fancy what\r\nthe roads were after eight and forty hours had elapsed.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts we would have said that they were impassable at the\r\nbest, and now they had been converted into veritable swamps by the\r\ndownpour of water, or filled in places with blocks of sandstone over\r\nwhich the wagons could not cross save we all put our shoulders to the\r\nhinder part helping the horses along, unless we stopped to clear away\r\nthe obstacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain the ascents were so steep that the horses from both wagons must\r\nbe hitched to one in order to get it up the hill, and when we came to\r\nthe other side it was necessary to put locked chains on the wheels,\r\nand, in addition, fasten large logs or tree tops to the back of the\r\nvehicles that they might drag behind and thus prevent us from going\r\nahead too swiftly.\r\n\r\nAnd all this was done in a heavy downpour of rain, when the women and\r\ngirls must of necessity remain under cover, except at such times as it\r\nwas absolutely necessary for them to alight in order to lessen the load.\r\n\r\nAs if to add to our discomfort, two of the animals began to show signs\r\nof faltering, and Ben Cushing told me confidentially one night when we\r\nwere halted in the foothills, with no shelter save the body of the\r\nwagon, and doing our utmost to keep a fire burning amid the rain, that\r\nit was his belief we should not succeed in gaining the river before the\r\npoor beasts were entirely worn out.\r\n\r\nThe way lay over a succession of sharp rises and yet sharper descents,\r\nwith the road in places falling off so much to one side that we were\r\nobliged to fasten ropes to the tops of the wagons, and all of us men\r\nlay hold, to prevent them from oversetting.\r\n\r\nSuch work as this might be necessary more than once in half a mile, we\r\nall the while wading knee-deep in the mire, and at times finding it\r\ndifficult to raise our feet because of the mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A STORM OF SNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the time when the rain changed to snow, and you can well\r\nfancy that if the road was well-nigh impassable before, it was soon\r\nin such a condition that one might say it would be impossible to go\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nEven the children were forced to get out and walk again and again, and\r\nI have seen Mistress Devoll and Mistress Rouse stop many a time to pick\r\nup their shoes which had been pulled from their feet by the clinging\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nFancy such traveling while the snow came down like feathers, weighting\r\nevery branch of the trees and every bush until they stood far out over\r\nthe narrow roadway, shedding their frosty burdens upon the passer-by!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that I could see the horses grow weaker with each mile\r\nwe advanced, and when night came, after we had traveled no more than\r\nsix or eight miles at the expense of the most severe labor, it was as\r\nmuch as we could do to keep them on their feet until the harness was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis was the time when Uncle Daniel had the advantage of us, for his\r\noxen plowed their way through the mire, giving apparently no more heed\r\nto the weight of the wagon than if it had been a child\'s toy cart, and\r\nagain and again did the old man unyoke the patient beasts in order to\r\nbring them back, at times more than half a mile over a hard road, to\r\nhelp one or the other of our wagons out of the mud, when, but for his\r\nassistance, they might have stayed there until the crack of doom, so\r\ndeeply were the wheels embedded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI can look back upon many days we spent while journeying from\r\nMassachusetts to the Ohio country with the greatest pleasure; but never\r\ndo I think of the time passed among the foothills, when the weather\r\nwas so bitter and the way so hard, without real mental distress, for\r\nthat journey, during at least eight days, was more like some horrible\r\nnightmare than a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to make any attempt at describing our passage across the Blue\r\nMountains, the Middle and the Tuscarora Mountains, it would simply be\r\nto repeat what I have already set down. Never once did we find a bit\r\nof the road where there was easy traveling, and it seemed to me that\r\neither the rain or the snow fell incessantly, until, wearied to the\r\nverge of exhaustion by day, we were forced to remain half frozen and\r\nwet to the skin from night until morning.\r\n\r\nThe women and children, if we camped at night where there were no\r\nhouses in which to take shelter, slept in the wagons, while the men\r\nand boys made shift as best they might beneath the carts, getting such\r\nwarmth as could be had under the few blankets at their disposal and the\r\nfires built close by, which were not of much avail because we could\r\nfind no dry fuel with which to feed them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen came a day which I remember more vividly than any other of all\r\nthat long journey, when we descended the last of the Tuscarora Range,\r\nand came to a fruitful valley, which we afterward learned was called\r\nAhwick, where was a small settlement, while here and there, when we\r\nwere on the higher land, could be seen farms which one might almost say\r\nwere ready for planting, despite the snow that yet lay deep among the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nMaster Rouse\'s wagon was leading the way and Uncle Daniel with his\r\nplodding oxen brought up the rear. It was Saturday night; we expected\r\nto remain at least two days, at the first place where we might sleep in\r\ncomfort, and it was necessary we find housing for all, which might not\r\nbe possible at the small log tavern we had heard would be found on the\r\nroad a short distance away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A FRIENDLY DUNKARD\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore our party came to a halt at the first promising-looking\r\nhouse, and Master Rouse set about learning what we might expect in the\r\nway of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe farm was owned by a German named Christian Hiples, who was of that\r\nreligious persuasion known as Dunkard, and a right friendly gentleman\r\nhe proved to be.\r\n\r\nIt really appeared to give him pain because he could not take all our\r\ncompany in and give us the comforts of home; but it seemed to me that\r\nhe was doing even more than his share when he agreed that Master Rouse\r\nand the members of his party should remain there, while the others of\r\nus continued on to the tavern.\r\n\r\nI regretted sorely that it was not my good fortune to be one of Master\r\nHiples\'s guests, for I had heard much concerning these people who call\r\nthemselves Dunkards, during our traveling through the state, and was\r\nmost eager to see them at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCaptain Haskell had told me that the Dunkards were Baptists who had\r\nbeen driven from Germany early in the eighteenth century, when they\r\ntook refuge in Pennsylvania. So far as I could find out, their religion\r\nconsists in condemning warfare, and setting their faces against suits\r\nat law. They have a peculiar belief regarding baptism, which Captain\r\nHaskell said has to do with triple immersion. They wash each others\'\r\nfeet before the Lord\'s Supper, and give to all members of their faith\r\nwhat is called the kiss of charity. It is in their eyes almost the same\r\nas a sin to dress other than plainly and cleanly, and from what I saw\r\nof Master Hiples\'s house during the short time we halted in front of\r\nit, I came to believe that cleanliness of home and its surroundings is\r\none of the articles of their belief, for I had not seen so pleasing a\r\nplace since we came out of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhen Master Rouse\'s family were thus comfortably housed, Mistress\r\nDevoll\'s team, with Uncle Daniel\'s oxen plodding patiently behind,\r\ncontinued on to a log tavern a short distance away, and the contrast\r\nbetween this place and that where Master Rouse\'s people were staying\r\nwas so great that for the first time since leaving Mattapoisett, I was\r\nnearly homesick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MASTER HIPLES\'S KINDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had comfortable quarters, if one judges comfort by being sheltered\r\nfrom the rain and having sufficient heat; but it was far from pleasant\r\nat the inn, and as soon as the horses had been properly cared for, I,\r\ndespite the fact that my legs were weary with long traveling, ran back\r\ndown the road to gaze with envy on Master Rouse and his family.\r\n\r\nThe old German was a kindly-faced man, with a long, white beard\r\nextending to his waist, and a voice as mild and gentle as any woman\'s.\r\nHe had five or six grown daughters, and when I got back to the farm\r\nthese young women were doing all they might for the comfort of the\r\nguests, without hope or expectation of being paid for the labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was, just outside the house, a huge brick oven in the open air,\r\nand these young women, aided by their father, were already heating it\r\nas if for a cooking bee. Sally Devoll told me it was their intention to\r\nbake a large quantity of bread to be given to us when we set off once\r\nmore on our journey.\r\n\r\nTherefore I came to have a friendly liking for these Dunkards, and\r\nbefore we left Ahwick Valley I was fully persuaded they were what might\r\ntruthfully be called the salt of the earth.\r\n\r\nA SURLY LANDLORD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to the log tavern there was considerable going on in\r\nthe way of excitement. The landlord, who had but one eye, having lost\r\nthe other, so we heard, during a fight when he was a younger man, was\r\nanything but gentle in manners, and his appearance was such that one\r\nfelt as if the lightest word would provoke harsh treatment.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that the racks in his stable had been built by\r\nnailing slats up and down at the end of the stalls, and into the places\r\nthus formed the hay was thrown from the loft.\r\n\r\nIsaac Barker and Ben Cushing were both very careful to see that their\r\nteams were well fed, and more particularly was it necessary now since\r\nwe had with us two horses that were ailing.\r\n\r\nWhen the animals were put into the stalls, after having been groomed\r\nand their coats dried, Isaac found that while the innkeeper intended\r\nto charge us for a certain amount of hay, the slats at the end of the\r\nstalls were placed so closely together that the poor beasts could not\r\nget a single wisp, struggle as they might.\r\n\r\nWithout delay he went to the landlord and told him that some different\r\narrangement must be made in regard to the racks, if our company was\r\nexpected to pay for hay.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper declared that he would conduct his tavern as best pleased\r\nhim; the hayracks had been built by him, and built to suit him,\r\ntherefore they would remain as they were. If our horses and oxen were\r\nstabled there, then would we pay so much money for each head on account\r\nof hay, whether they got it or not, the surly man claiming it was no\r\nfault of his if the animals were unable to get what was before them.\r\n\r\nYou can well fancy that Isaac\'s temper was aroused by this injustice,\r\nand straightway he told the man what he thought of such dealing,\r\nclaiming that unless the landlord himself was willing to remedy matters\r\nat once, he would take the affair into his own hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ISAAC FLOGS THE LANDLORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landlord threatened, so Uncle Daniel said, to punish severely\r\nwhoever dared to damage his property, and I arrived just at the time\r\nwhen Isaac, with a heavy ax, was breaking out every other slat in\r\nthe racks, thereby giving the beasts ample opportunity to feed, the\r\ninnkeeper meanwhile standing outside as if it was his purpose to lay\r\nhands on Isaac the moment he left the stable.\r\n\r\nAs we afterwards learned, the man had been considered, in his younger\r\ndays, a skillful fighter, and most likely believed there were few who\r\ncould stand against him, so he had no doubt about his ability to\r\npunish Isaac.\r\n\r\nI had never heard that Isaac was noted for skill with his fists, and\r\nbelieved he was likely to suffer severely, if the landlord should\r\nattack him. I therefore entreated Uncle Daniel to stand by with me in\r\norder to lend assistance, for I was not minded that one of our company\r\ncome to grief at that place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel grimly said that Isaac Barker could take care of himself,\r\nand that he was not fond of interfering, unless it was absolutely\r\nnecessary in order to save life.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of appearing concerned, Uncle Daniel quietly took up\r\nhis station near the door of the stable, where he stood whittling a bit\r\nof pine stick, while the innkeeper raged furiously, and Isaac continued\r\nto break out the slats until he had completed the task.\r\n\r\nThen he came out of the last stall where he had been working, threw\r\nthe ax on the floor without very much regard as to how it might fall,\r\nand began in a businesslike way to roll up his sleeves, keeping an eye\r\nmeanwhile on the movements of the landlord.\r\n\r\nThe two came together while I was waiting to see how they might begin\r\nthe battle, and in a twinkling, as it seemed to me, both were rolling\r\nhere and there about the stable floor, but in such a manner that one\r\nwith half an eye could see Isaac was by no means getting the worst of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A MUCH NEEDED LESSON\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact he flogged that miserly innkeeper severely, never\r\nletting up until the fellow cried that he had had enough; then Isaac\r\nsaid that he counted to be back that way in the spring, and if the\r\nslats in the hayracks had been replaced, he would give him another\r\nflogging compared with which this one would seem like child\'s play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI confess that I was frightened even after Isaac had acquitted himself\r\nin such a manly fashion, for I believed the landlord would contrive in\r\nsome way to make the remainder of our party suffer for what had been\r\ndone; but, strange as it may seem, he was as mild as one could desire,\r\nand instead of moving about in a surly fashion, finding fault with\r\neverything, as he had done when we first arrived, the fellow seemed\r\nstriving earnestly to do all he might for our welfare, whereupon Uncle\r\nDaniel grimly observed that "all he needed in order to make him a\r\ndecent kind of a man was a sound flogging every morning."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI would not recommend this method of insuring good treatment from\r\nlandlords in general; but I must say I was sorry Isaac had not been\r\nsufficiently provoked some time before, that he might have tried the\r\nsame treatment upon some of those innkeepers who had been so surly to\r\nus. In fact we met more than one so-called landlord during our journey\r\nacross the state of Pennsylvania, by the side of whom one of Uncle\r\nDaniel\'s oxen would have appeared gentlemanly.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, all of us, even including Isaac Barker, went to meeting with\r\nMaster Hiples\'s family, and not only were repaid by hearing a goodly\r\ndiscourse, but received an invitation to take supper with the good\r\nDunkard\'s family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A TIME OF REST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meal was an enjoyable one, although I fear, as I told Ben Cushing,\r\nthat he and I came very near disgracing, not only ourselves, but all\r\nour companions, by eating more than was seemly.\r\n\r\nIt was the most pleasant Sunday we had spent since leaving\r\nMattapoisett, and a day that seemed more fitting for goodly thoughts\r\nthan any other I could remember. As Uncle Daniel said when we stretched\r\nourselves out to sleep on the floor of the stable, the two rooms in the\r\ntavern having been given up to the women and children, it had been a\r\nvery profitable time.\r\n\r\nMonday also was a profitable day, for then Master Hiples\'s daughters\r\nworked with a will, making bread in such quantities that one might have\r\nthought they counted on provisioning an army, and all our women folks\r\ndid what they could to assist, while we boys and men cut and lugged\r\nfuel, so that we might not draw too heavily upon the old German\'s store\r\nof wood.\r\n\r\nThat night, when it was known we were to set off next day, Master\r\nHiples laid out a large supply of vegetables for all our company, and\r\nthis was a gift, in addition to the bread, since he refused to take\r\npayment therefor, asking only as much in the way of money as would\r\nsuffice to pay for the grain and the hay eaten by Master Rouse\'s horses.\r\n\r\nThanks to this friendly German, we were well supplied with food when we\r\nleft Ahwick Valley, Tuesday morning, and flattered ourselves with the\r\nbelief that the greater portion of the hardships were passed, for the\r\nailing horses seemed to be much improved, and traveled with no little\r\nspirit, thus causing us to believe they were rapidly recovering from\r\ntheir sickness.\r\n\r\nDuring three days we journeyed over roads that were far from good, save\r\nby comparison with those we found while crossing the mountains, and\r\nthen we came to the town of Bedford. We had in the meanwhile crossed\r\nSideling Hill, and forded some of the main branches of the Juniata, not\r\nwithout considerable difficulty and the assistance of Uncle Daniel\'s\r\noxen, for the fords were deep, and in some cases the bed of the river\r\nso soft that had a wagon remained still ever so short a time, it would\r\nsurely have been mired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PACK TRAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last three days we had seen evidences that in this wild\r\ncountry there was being carried on business of various kinds, for\r\nafter leaving Ahwick Valley we met here and there on the road long\r\nlines of pack horses, loaded with furs and ginsing, a root somewhat\r\nlike a potato, except that it has branches or roots shooting out from\r\nthe upper part, and is sent by our merchants to China, where it is\r\nconsidered very valuable as a medicine. There were other pack horses\r\nloaded with salt, or bales of dry goods and groceries, which were being\r\ncarried to the traders of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese pack trains, as Uncle Daniel called them, were very interesting.\r\nThe foremost horse wore bells, and it was he, rather than the driver,\r\nwho had charge of the beasts, and who did the guiding, for he went on\r\nas intelligently as could a human being, the remainder of the train,\r\nusually nine or ten horses, following him obediently.\r\n\r\nBecause there were no roads across the state of Pennsylvania from\r\nCarlisle to Pittsburgh over which heavily loaded wagons could pass, we\r\nwere told that all the traffic was carried on by pack horses, and it\r\nwas considered that one man could care for no more than ten animals.\r\n\r\nOne night, when we were told by the landlord of a small tavern about\r\nthese pack trains, Uncle Daniel said that we had best put aside from\r\nour minds all thought of buying anything at Pittsburgh, for if all\r\nthe goods were carried there on horseback, then the charges must be\r\nso heavy that ordinary people could not afford to pay that which the\r\nmerchants would demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A NIGHT ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of leaving Bedford we had our most disagreeable adventure.\r\nAbout four miles beyond that town the road divided, one trail leading\r\ndirectly to Pittsburgh, and the other to Sumrill\'s Ferry on the\r\nYoughiogheny River, which last was the path we must take, because\r\nit was the place where the _Mayflower_ had been built, and there we\r\nproposed to take boat for Marietta in order to avoid the wearisome\r\ntraveling on foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe women and children had been walking for some time, owing to the\r\nmiry road, and on coming to this place they decided to remain there\r\nawhile in order to rest. It so chanced that Isaac Barker took it into\r\nhis head to loiter with them, leaving Captain Haskell to drive his team.\r\n\r\nMaster Rouse also stayed behind, for no reason that any one could\r\ngive; thus we went on without them, never doubting but that within an\r\nhour they would overtake us, for according to the rate we had been\r\ntraveling, those who were on foot could speedily come up with our jaded\r\nhorses who were having all they could do to pull the wagons.\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel had on this day, as during the last two or three days,\r\noutstripped us with his slowly moving oxen, because they continued on\r\nsteadily, being so strong that the wagon, which was loaded as heavily\r\nas either of ours, was not mired.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed, and we still remained in advance, with no sign of\r\nthe coming of the women and children, yet nothing strange was thought\r\nof it at the time, and when I spoke of the matter to Ben Cushing as if\r\nit might be serious, he laughed at me, declaring that a foot passenger\r\ncould make his way without difficulty.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour before sunset we came to a small log hut which was\r\ncalled an inn by the man who owned it. It had but one room, which\r\nserved alike as kitchen, barroom and a place in which to sleep; but\r\nthere was shelter for the tired beasts in the stable, and a huge\r\nfireplace wherein we might pile fuel to our heart\'s content. We were\r\ntherefore not disposed to find fault.\r\n\r\nWe toasted ourselves well before the fire, wondering meanwhile how soon\r\nwe might be able to satisfy our hunger; for we could not have supper\r\nuntil the women came to cook it, this inn being only a housing place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FEARS ABOUT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hour passed, and even Captain Haskell began to show signs\r\nof anxiety. Another sixty minutes went by without bringing our\r\ncompanions; but after a third hour, Captain Haskell declared that some\r\nmisadventure must have befallen them, and set off over the road we had\r\njust traveled, refusing to allow any of us to accompany him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight before the captain and the other members\r\nof our party arrived. The poor children could hardly drag one foot\r\nafter the other, and the women looked as if nothing save the fear of\r\nremaining in the open air during the hours of darkness had forced them\r\nto continue the journey.\r\n\r\nWhile Ben Cushing and I were cooking supper, for the girls and the\r\nwomen were far too weary to do any work at the time, we learned that\r\nthe party had halted at the dividing of the ways much longer than they\r\nrealized, and it was nearly nightfall before the journey was continued.\r\n\r\nThen, when the sun had set, it was impossible for them to make their\r\nway along the faintly outlined road, save by clutching the bushes\r\non either side, and even then they strayed again and again into the\r\nthicket, until, what with this additional traveling and the exertion\r\nof plowing their way through the mire, all save Isaac Barker were\r\nplunged into a most gloomy, disagreeable frame of mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMistress Devoll declared that but for him who made sport when the\r\ndifficulties were the worst, and sang loudly when the others of the\r\ncompany were too thoroughly exhausted even to speak, they could not\r\nhave continued.\r\n\r\nOne can well fancy how welcome to them was the fire in the log tavern.\r\nThe smaller children stretched themselves out at full length on the\r\npuncheon floor in front of the blaze, while their mothers and sisters\r\ngave no heed to anything save the delicious sensation of being able\r\nto rest, enjoying to the utmost, I dare say, the feeling of security\r\nwhich came to them on arriving at that inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DESCENDING THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that none of our company had had sufficient sleep, we\r\ncontinued our journey as soon after daybreak as we could, and it was\r\nduring this day that our hearts were cheered by what might seem to some\r\npeople a foolish thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the road could be seen the little green leaves and\r\nbright scarlet berries of the partridge vine, or checkerberry plant,\r\nsuch as we all had seen each year roundabout Mattapoisett, and it had\r\nsuch a homelike appearance that it was as if we had suddenly come upon\r\na friend. The small children loitered behind the wagons to pick the\r\ntiny red berries, while the girls chewed the aromatic leaves, and more\r\nthan one of the men followed their example, for it was like being in\r\nMassachusetts again after a long disagreeable dream.\r\n\r\nThe log inn at which we had slept the night previous was evidently\r\nbuilt on what is generally called the "height of the land," for now we\r\nwere descending the Allegheny Mountains, cheered by the fact that the\r\nstreams of water from the springs ran with us along our road, telling\r\nthat we had come to where the greater portion of the remainder of the\r\njourney would be on descending ground. These streams were to accompany\r\nus on our way now, instead of running in the opposite direction as\r\nduring all the time we had been among the foothills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we had come to the base of the mountains we found ourselves on a\r\nbroad, level range, which was called "The Glades." Captain Haskell said\r\nit had very much the appearance of a prairie. If this be true, which I\r\nhave no reason to doubt, then I have no desire to see a prairie; for\r\nThe Glades was a most forlorn place, being but sparsely dotted with\r\ntrees and covered with a coarse grass, at which even the oxen turned up\r\ntheir noses.\r\n\r\nThen, having slept in the open two nights, we came to Laurel Ridge,\r\nwhich bounds the western side of The Glades, and must have been so\r\nnamed because of the laurel which grows in such profusion on the rocky\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nNow we were forced to climb once more over a road quite as rough as any\r\nwe had come upon, and again all the women and the children were forced\r\nto walk, much to their discomfort, for on this ridge the snow had\r\nfallen in large quantities. Every one was soon wet to the knees, and\r\nplodding through the snow and mud rendered walking quite as difficult\r\nas any we had yet experienced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn this day the women and children, remembering what had occurred just\r\nafter we left Bedford, went on ahead of the wagons. When the afternoon\r\nwas about half spent they came upon a stream of water at the western\r\nfoot of the ridge, which was far too deep for them to ford, therefore\r\nthey were obliged to wait until we came up.\r\n\r\nLuckily for them, however, there was a small log house near by the road\r\nin which dwelt a motherly-looking Irish woman, and with her our people\r\nvisited, much to their pleasure and comfort, until we arrived.\r\n\r\nBecause of the difficulties in the way, the wagons did not come to the\r\nstream until nearly nightfall; but then the passage was quickly made,\r\nand we hurried on two miles farther, to where was an inn, said to be as\r\ngood as any other to be found between Sumrill\'s Ferry and Carlisle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    NEARING THE END OF THE JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day we crossed Chestnut Ridge, the last of the hills, and so named\r\nbecause of the wondrous growth of chestnut trees which just then were\r\nyielding up their fruit to the nipping frost. Our children and girls\r\nfilled their pockets with the nuts, while more than once all three of\r\nthe wagons were halted that we might lay in a store of what would, on a\r\npinch, serve as food.\r\n\r\nWe had climbed mountain after mountain, crossed ridge after ridge,\r\nuntil it seemed as if all the earth was a succession of ascents and\r\ndescents; we had waded knee-deep through mire or snow, and literally\r\nfought our way along all that weary distance from Mattapoisett to\r\nthe Youghiogheny River, until we had come to Sumrill\'s Ferry, where\r\nit was believed we could make arrangements for a more comfortable\r\ncontinuation of the long journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWell it was that we arrived at this time, which was near the last of\r\nNovember, with winter close at hand, for the two horses which had been\r\nailing now seemingly grew worse, and during the eight and forty hours\r\nbefore our arrival at the ferry, they were hardly more than able to\r\nkeep their feet, let alone doing any portion of the pulling.\r\n\r\nI believe that a few days more of traveling would have killed them, and\r\nindeed they were hardly more than dead beasts when we took them out\r\nof the harness at the ferry, congratulating ourselves upon having come\r\nthus far on our journey without mishap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AT SUMRILL\'S FERRY\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we learned of those people who went out from Danvers and Hartford.\r\nWe saw where they built the _Mayflower_, and, in fact, we lodged at\r\nthe very inn where some of them had lived while making ready for the\r\njourney down the river.\r\n\r\nSumrill\'s Ferry is not a large settlement, but a thriving one. Here\r\nwere boat builders, ready to make any kind of craft needed.\r\n\r\nTo hear them talk of what they believed must have been our experiences\r\nduring the journey, one would have said they looked upon us as more\r\nthan foolish to have ventured so much in order to make a settlement in\r\nthe wild Ohio country.\r\n\r\nBefore we had been at this settlement an hour, Uncle Daniel came upon\r\nBenjamin Slocomb and his family, who had left Danvers nearly four weeks\r\nbefore we started from Mattapoisett. Master Slocomb had waited at the\r\nferry nine days until a boat could be finished in a manner to please\r\nhim, and was on the point of setting off when Uncle Daniel saw him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PARTING WITH UNCLE DANIEL\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Slocomb\'s craft was not so well loaded but that he could,\r\nwithout inconvenience, take on board Uncle Daniel\'s wagon with all its\r\nbelongings, except the oxen, so he urged the old man to finish the\r\njourney with him, the two having been friends for many a long year. The\r\nresult was that Uncle Daniel parted company with us before nightfall,\r\nleaving his oxen to our care, but taking everything else he owned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have a farm picked out for you folks, an\' made ready to plow,"\r\nthe old man cried cheerily, as Master Slocomb\'s clumsy craft was\r\npoled out into the current. All our company stood on the river\'s bank\r\nwatching the departure, and really sorry to part with our fellow\r\ntraveler, who had always shown himself willing to lend a hand when it\r\nwas needed, without regard to the labor.\r\n\r\nWe called after him until he was beyond earshot, Isaac Barker cracking\r\njokes as usual, and then we set about making arrangements for our own\r\njourney down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OUR FLATBOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were several boats already built and for sale, and Master Rouse\r\nand Captain Haskell decided upon one which was not yet finished, so far\r\nas the accommodations for passengers were concerned, since it had no\r\nroof. It was by far the best craft, to my thinking, of all we saw there.\r\n\r\nIt was about forty feet long and twelve feet wide, of ample size and\r\ndepth to carry all our wagons, as well as our people, to say nothing\r\nof as much space as would be required in which to house not only our\r\nhorses, but Uncle Daniel\'s oxen.\r\n\r\nIt was not our purpose to take the beasts in the boat at that time, but\r\nrather to send them across the land to a settlement called Buffalo, at\r\nthe mouth of Buffalo Creek, fifty-three miles from the ferry, whereas\r\nthe distance was considerably more than a hundred miles by the waterway.\r\n\r\nThis was to be done not simply because we wanted to avoid the labor\r\nof caring for them, but because the Youghiogheny River was so shallow\r\nat that season of the year that a boat drawing more than eighteen or\r\ntwenty inches of water could not float upon it.\r\n\r\nThe craft which Captain Haskell and Master Rouse had bought would draw,\r\nperhaps, seventeen inches with all our belongings, save the horses\r\nand oxen, on board, therefore we would send them across the country\r\nin charge of Michael Rouse, Isaac Barker, and Ben Cushing, counting\r\nto take them up when we came to Buffalo Creek, for there the river\r\nwas deeper, the current swifter, and we should have no difficulty in\r\ncarrying them.\r\n\r\nA great time we had of it, packing our goods into the boat in a way\r\nto economize every inch of space, and when this had been done, and we\r\nlearned how much of the craft could be given over to our own use, we\r\nset about making arrangements for comfort, first by covering the stern\r\nof the boat with mud to the depth of ten or twelve inches, and then\r\nbuilding around it a fireplace of stone, where the cooking could be\r\ndone without danger of setting fire to the timbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CATTLE ARE SENT AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith blankets and sheets we made a covering for the after part of our\r\nark, so that the women and children would be kept dry in case of a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nWhen all this had been done, and we had bought as much in the way of\r\nprovisions as could be purchased at a reasonable price, Isaac, Michael,\r\nand Ben set off with the beasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt gave me a homesick feeling to see them march away; we had been\r\ntogether so long and had gone through so many hardships.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour after the horses and oxen, with their drivers, had\r\ndisappeared, we pushed off from the shore, and very strange did it seem\r\nto be carried along by the current, instead of fighting one\'s way\r\nthrough mud.\r\n\r\nI said to myself that now it was the same as coming to the end of our\r\njourney, for we had simply to sit still and let the river do the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis, however, I soon understood was a mistake, for although we were\r\nnot forced to trudge through mud and snow, there was ample work for men\r\nand boys in holding the clumsy craft out from the shore where she was\r\nlike to go aground, or again, in leaping overboard and actually lifting\r\nher off some shoal on which she had grounded, as it seemed to me, in a\r\nvery spirit of perverseness.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we were forced to work quite as hard in navigating the\r\nboat as when we plodded over the miry road, and yet there was this\r\nadvantage, we were able to eat our meals at regular times.\r\n\r\nWhat with rowing and poling, and now and then leaping waist deep\r\ninto the water to shove her from the shoals, we contrived, after a\r\nconsiderable time, to get as far as the Monongahela River, where the\r\nwater was deeper and the current swifter, permitting us to get some\r\nrest now and then, and for the first time since leaving Mattapoisett\r\ndid this journey begin to seem pleasing.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday evening when we arrived at Pittsburgh, making our clumsy\r\ncraft fast to a stake on the shore at the junction of the Allegheny and\r\nMonongahela Rivers, with the Ohio in full view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AT PITTSBURGH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Pittsburgh, the largest we had seen since coming into the\r\nstate of Pennsylvania, appeared to me a most prosperous settlement.\r\nThere was the fort called Pitt, and half a dozen shops, in addition\r\nto the houses which I was told sheltered about five hundred people.\r\nTherefore you can understand that it was indeed a place of considerable\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nIt was not so late in the day but that Master Rouse and Captain Haskell\r\nwent up into the town, after our boat had been made fast to the stake\r\nas I have said, in order to attend to some business, for on the\r\nfrontier one does not observe so religiously the Sabbath as at home,\r\nand travelers who must continue their journey with as little delay as\r\npossible, are allowed to make necessary purchases even on Sunday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the two men went on shore there was nothing said as to how soon\r\nthey might come back; but we supposed both would return as soon as\r\ntheir business was done.\r\n\r\nTherefore the girls at once set about cooking supper; but when the\r\nmeal was ready our gentlemen were not returned, and we waited for them\r\nuntil the corn cake was nearly cold, while the fish which we had caught\r\nduring the day were much the worse for having remained from the fire so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\'clock Mistress Rouse and Mistress Devoll decided that the\r\nyounger children must be fed, in order that they might be put to bed\r\nat a reasonable hour, and therefore we ate the meal without waiting\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nWell it was that we did so, if we counted on satisfying our hunger that\r\nday, for two hours later the men were yet absent, and then Mistress\r\nDevoll told me we should make our preparations for the night.\r\n\r\nNow you know that this was no small task. The beds and bedding were\r\nstowed in the wagons during the day, and when night came, all must\r\nbe taken out and spread upon the bottom of the boat for the women\r\nand children, while the boys--and of course I was numbered among\r\nthem--slept in one of the wagons.\r\n\r\nOn this night, however, because Captain Haskell and Master Rouse had\r\nnot returned, Mistress Rouse believed that I should make my bed at the\r\nend of the boat near the fireplace, where I could stand guard, or, in\r\nother words, where I might be ready to do whatsoever would be needed\r\nduring the hours of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TOO MUCH WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nI congratulated myself not a little that I was to sleep upon a very\r\ncomfortable sack of feathers, which had thus far served Captain\r\nHaskell. Without giving very much heed to the fact that the men yet\r\nremained in town when there was every reason why they should have\r\ncome back to the boat, I laid myself down, and was speedily lost in\r\nslumber, for the work during the day had been severe, and I was needing\r\nrest sorely.\r\n\r\nI may have slept two or three hours, certainly as long as that, when\r\nsuddenly I was awakened by a sense of discomfort, and, turning over,\r\nwas brought to my feet very quickly by discovering that the water had\r\ncome in even over the top of my bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI cried out, not from fear, but rather from surprise, and on the\r\ninstant the women, as well as the older girls, being awakened, started\r\naft to learn what might be the matter, when they plunged nearly to\r\ntheir knees in water.\r\n\r\nStraightway the outcry was great, for they, as well as I, believed that\r\nthe boat was sinking beneath us.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the women seemed to consider that I was able to play\r\nthe part of a man at such a time, and Mistress Devoll asked in a tone\r\nof fear what ought to be done.\r\n\r\nDuring an instant I stood undecided, hardly having my wits about me,\r\nand then, still believing the clumsy craft was going to the bottom, I\r\nurged that we get on shore as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ESCAPE OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFortunately for us the boat had been moored with a short hawser, in\r\nsuch a manner that when Captain Haskell and Master Rouse left us they\r\ncould readily leap from the gunwale to the land, and after the women\r\nwere gathered on the shoreward side of the boat, instead of being\r\nobliged to jump, I found that they might readily step over the rail\r\nwithout wetting their feet in water, although they sank above the tops\r\nof their shoes in mud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnce they had what might be called a firm footing, I passed the younger\r\nchildren over, and while doing so the twins made a great outcry,\r\nwhereupon Mistress Devoll and Mistress Rouse commanded them to remain\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nOur cries and shouts awakened a man who proved to be of great\r\nassistance. His house stood on the shore near where our boat was\r\nmoored, and he came to the door quickly, calling out to know what was\r\nthe matter, whereupon I told him our boat was sinking and that some\r\nhalf-drowned women and children were shivering on the shore.\r\n\r\nAll of us were soaked to the skin, for we had floundered about in\r\nthe water when first awakened, and the man cried out that we should\r\nremain where we were until he could light a lantern and come to our\r\nassistance, which he did in a very short space of time.\r\n\r\nThen, without waiting to learn what might be happening to the boat,\r\nhe insisted that all should go to his house, which was hardly more\r\nthan a hundred paces away, and once there he built a big fire in the\r\nfireplace, after which he proposed that we older boys go with him to\r\nlook after the craft, while the women and children dried their clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           REPAIRING DAMAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the boat again it was seen that there would have been\r\nno danger of her sinking, even though we remained aboard all night. It\r\nseems that the river had fallen after we made fast to the shore, and\r\nthe landward side of the boat rested on the river bank as the waters\r\nreceded, thus allowing the outer portion of the craft to settle in the\r\nstream until the water ran through the seams in the planking about the\r\ngunwale, for they were badly calked, having been hurriedly finished\r\nby the builders at Sumrill\'s Ferry while we were putting our goods on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of our shoving the huge boat into deeper\r\nwater, therefore the kindly stranger awakened some of his neighbors,\r\nwho, with such small aid as I could give, set about taking out the\r\nbedding and the clothing which had been wetted completely, carrying\r\nthe stuff up to the house that it might be dried, and this work served\r\nto keep us busy until sunrise, when Master Rouse and Captain Haskell\r\ncame down to the shore.\r\n\r\nThey had been busy with some people who intended to go to Marietta,\r\nand were so eager to make certain business arrangements that it seemed\r\nbest to sleep at the tavern, rather than return at a late hour to the\r\nflatboat, and one can readily imagine their surprise at finding us with\r\na good third of our cargo on shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe kind man who had labored nearly all night in our behalf lived alone\r\nin a large log hut, and insisted on preparing breakfast for all our\r\ncompany, not even allowing the girls to do their share of the work,\r\nthereby showing himself to be a skillful cook as well as a friendly\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nWhen Master Rouse would have paid him for his labor, as well as for\r\nthe food which he had provided, the man refused to take a penny,\r\nclaiming that he had done only as he would be done by, and therefore I\r\nstill have a kind feeling in my heart for Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nMaster Rouse, Captain Haskell, and I soon had the water bailed out of\r\nthe flatboat and the bedding, now dried, on board; before the afternoon\r\nwas more than half spent, we were ready to set out on the last stage of\r\nour long journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OUR PILOT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had, however, a new member of the company, an old trapper and hunter\r\nby the name of Bruce. Our gentlemen had met him at the tavern, and\r\nlearned that he was familiar with the river, knowing all the shoals,\r\nor at least claiming that he did, and I have no reason to doubt his\r\nstatement in view of what occurred before we arrived at Marietta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe had intended to travel in his canoe, which was neither more nor less\r\nthan a dugout, by which I mean the trunk of a tree hollowed out to make\r\na shell-like craft which would carry a very heavy load. It required\r\ndelicate handling because of its liability to overset in case any of\r\nthe cargo was suddenly shifted. In fact, the old hunter laughingly said\r\nthat if he shifted his pipe from one side of his mouth to the other the\r\ncanoe would heel.\r\n\r\nHe had with him flour, half a dozen or more sides of bacon, a number of\r\nbeaver traps, his camp kettle and equipage, not to speak of his rifle,\r\nblankets, and ammunition sufficient to last him during the winter\r\nseason, while he was in the wilderness far from any other human being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis canoe was lashed alongside the flatboat and he stood at the huge\r\nsteering oar which swung from the stern, or rather from that end of the\r\ncraft which we chose to call the stern, for, it being square at both\r\nends, we might as well have called one the bow as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A CHANGE OF WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about three o\'clock when we started. The sky was overcast, and\r\nthere were signs of rain in the south, while the wind shifted here and\r\nthere until almost any one might have proved himself a weather prophet\r\nby predicting a storm.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of sunset the wind swung around to the northwest and\r\nblew fiercely across the bend of the river where we then were, kicking\r\nup such a sea as to send the crests of the waves over the side of the\r\nboat, threatening to sink, if not overset, the unwieldy craft.\r\n\r\nWe men and boys worked at the oars to the best of our ability, striving\r\nto force the clumsy vessel toward the Pennsylvania shore, for the\r\nopposite bank, or what was called the Indian side, was said to be\r\ninfested with savages who, even though they were supposed to be at\r\npeace with white people, robbed flatboats and killed travelers at every\r\nfavorable opportunity.\r\n\r\nMaster Bruce\'s huge canoe pounded and thumped against the side of\r\nthe boat until it seemed certain she would stave in the planks, and\r\nfinally, regardless of the fact that all his property was on board, the\r\nold hunter cut her adrift.\r\n\r\nThen, while we rode more easily, the danger was lessened but little,\r\nfor the wind increased in force, and the waves grew higher, until all\r\nof us boys were forced to work at bailing in order to keep the water\r\nfrom rising so high as to soak our goods.\r\n\r\nI had not realized that there was any actual danger until I heard the\r\nold hunter say to Captain Haskell that we must take our chances of\r\nbeing attacked by the Indians, because it was impossible to force the\r\nflatboat over to the Pennsylvania shore, therefore we ought to make\r\nharbor wherever we could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOISY FEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this time the women and the girls had remained reasonably quiet,\r\napparently too much frightened to make any sound; but overhearing what\r\nMaster Bruce said regarding the necessity of our taking shelter on the\r\nIndian shore, they set up a great outcry.\r\n\r\nCaptain Haskell and Master Rouse, although they were needed at the\r\noars, could do no less than go amidships where the shrieking ones\r\nwere gathered, and literally force them to hold their peace, for it was\r\nmost distracting to hear the noise while we had as much as we could do\r\nto work the craft.\r\n\r\nThe old hunter showed that he knew much regarding the handling of such\r\na boat as we were then aboard; for in a short time, by skillful pulling\r\nat the plank that served as rudder, aided by those of us who tugged at\r\nthe oars, she was brought under a high bluff, on the Indian side of\r\nthe river, and there made fast by a hawser to trees growing near the\r\nwater\'s edge.\r\n\r\nWe were no sooner moored than Mistress Devoll sprang over the side of\r\nthe boat to the land, declaring that while the storm raged as it did\r\nthen she would not trust herself on board even though the Indians might\r\nbe near, and her example was speedily followed by the other women and\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me a foolhardy act to go on shore when we knew there was\r\ndanger the Indians might make an attack, yet Master Rouse and Captain\r\nHaskell held their peace, allowing the women to do as they pleased,\r\nwhile the old hunter set about putting up a shelter for them by means\r\nof four poles, with blankets stretched across after the fashion of a\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThere the women made beds for themselves and the children, rather than\r\ngo back to the boat, even though to my mind it was safely secured and\r\ncould not come to any harm.\r\n\r\nMaster Bruce was not content with having done this. Just before having\r\nlanded we saw a thin thread of smoke rising from the trees half a mile\r\ndistant, and he set off as soon as the makeshift tent had been put up,\r\nrunning the chances of coming upon the savages, in order to discover\r\nwho our neighbors might be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A REAL FEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it so happened, fortunately for us, that the smoke had come from\r\nthe camp of white men, and of them Bruce begged, or bought, half of a\r\nfat deer, broiling enough steaks on the coals to satisfy the hunger of\r\nthe younger members of the party, while he roasted a goodly portion,\r\nhunter-fashion, on a hickory skewer stuck up in the earth in front of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe girls made coffee and corn bread, and we feasted that night.\r\n\r\nCaptain Haskell and I went on board the boat to sleep, and I was not\r\nsorry we did so, for before morning another storm came up, and when we\r\nlooked out from beneath the wagon covers, after sunrise, snow covered\r\nthe ground to the depth of two inches.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly; the wind had died away until there was\r\nnot sufficient air stirring to lift a feather, and nothing prevented\r\nus from continuing the journey without delay, which we did, the girls\r\nbroiling venison steaks in our fireplace at the stern of the boat while\r\nwe sailed along.\r\n\r\nMaster Bruce told us we might take no little credit to ourselves, for\r\nwe most likely were the first white people to venture on the Indian\r\nshore and remain there all night, since Pittsburgh had become a town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FINDING THE CANOE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt surprised me not a little because the old hunter failed to mourn the\r\nloss of his canoe, for on board was all his equipment for the winter\'s\r\nwork, and, having lost it, he must go back to Pittsburgh to replenish\r\nhis stores and procure another craft.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is folly for one to worry and fret over that which cannot\r\nbe avoided. Master Bruce might have made himself miserable bewailing\r\nthe loss of his goods and nothing would have been changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNear noon we saw the craft on the Pennsylvania side of the river, where\r\nit had been blown by the wind, lying there comfortably ashore, as if\r\nwaiting for us to take it in tow.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult matter to pull our craft around to get hold of the\r\ncanoe; but we finally did so, and would have worked more than one day\r\nrather than allow the old hunter to meet with a loss.\r\n\r\nWhen it was made fast alongside once more, and we were drifting with\r\nthe current, Master Bruce went on board to learn what portion of his\r\ngoods had been lost during the storm, and to his surprise found that\r\nonly one of the traps was missing, although the flour was more or less\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nWhy the canoe was not overset by the wind, unstable as it was, I could\r\nnot understand until Master Bruce explained that the weight of the\r\nflour and the traps, resting on the bottom of the boat, must have\r\nserved as ballast to hold it steady, and again, most-like, it went\r\nashore within a short time after having been cut adrift.\r\n\r\nI supposed we had quite a journey before us from Pittsburgh to Buffalo\r\nCreek, and therefore was surprised when at sunset I asked Master Bruce\r\nconcerning the distance, and he told me that within an hour we would\r\narrive at the place where we were to take on the cattle and horses, for\r\nit was Master Rouse\'s intent to carry with us Uncle Daniel\'s oxen, if\r\nthe old man had not succeeded in loading them on his friend\'s craft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BUFFALO CREEK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not yet nine o\'clock when we came within sight of the few\r\ntwinkling lights in the settlement of Buffalo, and I could hear Isaac\r\nBarker\'s boisterous laugh while we were yet half a mile away, therefore\r\nI knew he was indulging in his quips and jokes.\r\n\r\nIt must have been that he was on the lookout for us, for before the\r\nflatboat was made fast to the shore, he, with Michael Rouse and Ben\r\nCushing, was calling out words of welcome, and asking how the journey\r\nhad progressed. As soon as they were on board, our craft having been\r\nmade fast, we learned without surprise that the two ailing horses had\r\ndied during the march.\r\n\r\nA few moments later, as I was about to overhaul the bedding in order\r\nto make it ready for the children, whose time for going to sleep had\r\nalready passed, Mistress Rouse said to me that she had no intention of\r\nremaining on board the boat during the night.\r\n\r\nThe fear that another storm might come up, or that we might be\r\nhalf-swamped as at Pittsburgh, caused the good woman to shrink from\r\nspending the night on the boat when it was possible to sleep ashore.\r\nIsaac was therefore urged to find some shelter, which he speedily did\r\nby proposing that they take possession of a log hut which stood on a\r\npoint of land near the mouth of Buffalo Creek, where he, with Michael\r\nand Ben, had slept the night before.\r\n\r\nThe building had been abandoned, as it seemed, or else its owner\r\nwas making a long journey, perhaps on a hunting trip, and would not\r\ncomplain if we made free with his property, it being the custom on the\r\nfrontier for travelers to take advantage of such shelter as they might\r\nfind unoccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE MARCH ACROSS THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nI counted on hearing from Ben Cushing and Isaac Barker entertaining\r\nstories that night, concerning the march across the country, but much\r\nto my disappointment they had nothing of interest to tell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nForced to accommodate their pace to the slowly moving oxen, they\r\ntrudged along hour after hour, starting well before daylight and\r\ncontinuing as long as it was possible to see at night, in order to\r\ncover the greatest possible distance, with nothing whatsoever to break\r\nthe monotony of the march.\r\n\r\nWe were up long before the sun next morning, for now it was necessary\r\nto take the live stock on board our flatboat. We were forced to embark\r\nUncle Daniel\'s oxen, he having passed Buffalo some time before Isaac\r\nand Ben arrived there, and when we had all the beasts on board we were\r\npacked like herring in a box, each in his own special place and with\r\nvery little opportunity to move about.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were nearly at our journey\'s end; the current of the river\r\nran swiftly as compared with the stream at Pittsburgh, and there was no\r\nlonger reason to fear that the Indians might do any harm, even if there\r\nhad been cause before.\r\n\r\nIn exactly four days from the time of leaving Pittsburgh, we arrived at\r\nthe mouth of the Muskingum. It was well we had come to an end of our\r\njourney so soon, for ice was already beginning to form in the river,\r\nand before daylight the Muskingum was frozen quite solidly.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after we had moored the flatboat to the bank, Master\r\nDevoll came on board.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not said that this march of ours was attended with\r\ndanger, and in fact it was not, yet there were many chances that one\r\nor another of us, if not all, might have fallen by the wayside, owing\r\neither to the roughness of the way, or the fatigue caused by such\r\nincessant labor with insufficient lodging, to say nothing of the poor\r\nfood owing to the fact that we had not the necessary vessels in which\r\nto prepare it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              AT MARIETTA\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we had really made the flatboat fast, Mistress Devoll and\r\nMistress Rouse were almost at their wits\' ends with fear, for in the\r\nwoods and on the sides of the hill back of Fort Harmar could be seen\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of camp fires, and one of those idlers who are\r\never to be found at the riverside of a settlement, told us there were\r\nno less than three hundred savages encamped there, having come to make\r\na treaty with our people on the 9th of January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMaster Devoll laughed at his wife\'s fears, claiming that the savages\r\nwere as peaceful as lambs, although at the time I doubted very much\r\nwhether he believed his own words.\r\n\r\nHowever, the women and children did not remain aboard our flatboat, for\r\nMaster Devoll took them to the _Mayflower_, which was moored near by,\r\nwhere were better accommodations for sleeping, and in our craft only\r\nBen Cushing and I were left on guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe two lads spent a full hour that evening, congratulating ourselves\r\nupon having finished the journey and questioning as to what we would do\r\nnow we were come into this Ohio country.\r\n\r\nWe had been more than eight weeks on the road, advancing all the time,\r\none day after another, except the eight and forty hours which were\r\nspent with Master Hiples in that village where live the Dunkards, and,\r\nsave for the death of the two horses, we had come through with no\r\ngreater mishap than the loss of a two-quart tin measure and a blanket\r\nbelonging to Mistress Rouse. This was doing remarkably well, when you\r\nconsider that never one of the party, not even the men, had undertaken\r\nsuch a journey before.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we found the Muskingum River frozen from shore to shore,\r\nand until spring came the stream was never so free of ice that we could\r\nhave propelled our boat, therefore we arrived, as one might say, just\r\nin the nick of time, for a delay of four and twenty hours would have\r\nfound us frozen in at some point above the town, from which it would\r\nhave been necessary to continue on foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PLANS FOR THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel was on the river bank to meet us next morning, before we\r\nput the animals ashore, and then, very much to my disappointment, he\r\nannounced that it was not his intention to remain long in Marietta.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he, with several others, had decided to go thirteen\r\nmiles down the Ohio River, where they had already staked out a town,\r\nand there build for themselves a settlement which should be wholly made\r\nup of those who had been neighbors in Massachusetts. However, he was\r\nforced to remain with us at Marietta during the winter.\r\n\r\nMaster Devoll took his family from the _Mayflower_ at an early hour\r\nnext morning and moved their belongings to Campus Martius, where he\r\nhoped to remain until his house was finished, and there did Mistress\r\nDevoll bid me come, saying I should find a home with them until it was\r\npossible to settle upon plans for the future, while Master Devoll told\r\nme that if I wanted to work at fair wages as a farm hand, he would give\r\nme employment as soon as spring had come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt may be that I was a simple for not accepting the offer which was\r\nmade in all kindness of heart, and yet I had a desire to become\r\nsomething more than an ordinary laborer, so, thanking him heartily for\r\nhis generosity, I went out into the world on my own account, having as\r\npartner Ben Cushing.\r\n\r\nWe two young fellows had no idea of what it might be possible for us\r\nto do. This new country was all so different from what we had seen\r\nin Massachusetts; the ways of the people would be different now they\r\nhad come so far from home, and we were without means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood, save for our willingness to work and the strength of our\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INSPECTING THE TOWN OF MARIETTA\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, penniless and undecided though we were, there was no intention\r\non our part to force matters, and after the flatboat had been unloaded,\r\nwe set about looking the town over, eager to see what had been done in\r\nso short a time, and speculating as to what we might do at some future\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI am free to confess that the fortification with the high-sounding\r\nname of Campus Martius was pleasing to look upon. It was an imposing\r\nbuilding, not such a one as you would expect to find in a wild\r\ncountry, and it lent to its surroundings a certain sense of security,\r\nbecause one could readily understand that it was built in a manner to\r\ndefy the attacks of the savages.\r\n\r\nOutside the palisade, extending in either direction along the river\r\nbank were ten log cabins, very few of which were occupied by their\r\nowners, for those who had built them had not as yet brought their\r\nfamilies to Marietta. The streets were laid out in regular order, but\r\nlike those we saw in Harrisburg, they were still filled with the stumps\r\nof trees, and the only signs of highways were the tiny paths looking\r\nmuch like sheep tracks as they wound in and out among the trees,\r\navoiding the wet places, and leading where the way was most easy to\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nNo one gave any heed to us, and we wandered here and there looking into\r\nthis house or criticizing another which was but half finished, until\r\nwe came to where we could see Fort Harmar with the Indian encampment\r\nbehind it. Then we decided upon the next day\'s entertainment, for Ben\r\nCushing insisted that since this was our first chance to see a savage,\r\nwe should spend at least a few hours there.\r\n\r\nWhile it promised a novelty, I was by no means easy in mind regarding\r\nan inspection of the red men. Nevertheless I kept all these fears to\r\nmyself, hoping Ben might give over his excursion when we learned that\r\nthe ice was not strong enough to bear us up.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, it was possible to gain Fort Harmar, for the\r\nnight was very cold, and ice formed of a thickness to render traveling\r\non the river safe, therefore I was forced to agree to his proposition\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A TEMPORARY HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we could inspect these Indian visitors, it was necessary we\r\nshould make some provision for food and shelter, for neither of us\r\nwanted to present himself to Mistress Rouse or Mistress Devoll as a\r\nbeggar, therefore we set about providing for ourselves a temporary home.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt but that we would have been allowed to take possession\r\nof any of the log houses which were not occupied; but that would have\r\nbeen much like begging a shelter, therefore we proposed to Master\r\nDevoll that we occupy the flatboat during the time that it remained\r\nfast in the ice.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a happy idea. He told us that it was his intention to\r\nallow the boat to remain where it was until spring, since he could do\r\nno different because of the ice, and then it could be used by those who\r\nproposed to make a settlement fourteen miles farther down the Ohio.\r\nHe also said that we were at liberty to use it as we saw fit during\r\nthe entire winter, providing, of course, that we did no damage to the\r\ncraft; but at the same time advising that, instead of trying to keep\r\nhouse by ourselves, we live either with his family or Master Rouse\'s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe said we should find plenty of game in the woods, and proposed that\r\nwe borrow his gun whenever we were in need of meat, promising to\r\nsupply us with ammunition; but this last we agreed to only with the\r\nunderstanding that he keep a strict account of what was used, so that\r\nwhen we had earned sufficient money with which to cancel the debt, we\r\nmight pay him.\r\n\r\nAt this he laughed, declaring that we were indeed high and mighty for\r\nlads who yet had their way to make through the world; but at the same\r\ntime clapping us heartily on the shoulders as he vowed he liked our\r\nspirit and had no doubt but that we should succeed in making our way,\r\nfor there must be ample opportunity for willing lads to earn fair wages\r\nwhen spring had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BUYING LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing Master Devoll did for which both Ben and I have good\r\nreason to bless him. He insisted that we make a bargain with Colonel\r\nPutnam for one of the eight-acre lots, agreeing to pay for it within\r\na year\'s time, and inasmuch as the price fixed upon for those who had\r\ncome to settle was the same as that made by the government, meaning\r\none dollar an acre, it surely seemed as if we could contrive within\r\na twelve-month to earn that much money in addition to supporting\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nWithout loss of time we went to the small building which Colonel Putnam\r\ncalled the "Land Office," and there made application for one of the\r\nlots as Master Devoll had advised. On the instant after Colonel Putnam\r\nspoke, we understood that Master Devoll had not contented himself\r\nsimply with giving advice, but had been to the land office before us,\r\nstating who we were and what were our intentions, therefore Colonel\r\nPutnam not only was ready to receive us, but had much to say which\r\nsounded to my ears like unwon praise.\r\n\r\n"It is such lads as you that we want here in Marietta," he said\r\nheartily. "Your records are good, so far as I have learned, and it\r\npleases me to set aside an eight-acre lot for you. Decide upon any one\r\nof those which have not already been taken, and I will enter it in your\r\nnames."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen he put before us a plan of the town of Marietta, whereon each\r\npiece of land was marked out, and we, instead of going out to look\r\nfor ourselves that we might decide which was the most valuable or\r\ndesirable, said to him that he should put our names down on whatever\r\nlot he saw fit, whereupon he laughingly did so, and we afterward\r\nlearned that we had been, perhaps, wise in leaving to him the selection.\r\n\r\nThat night after we had become landowners, as you might say, we slept\r\non board the flatboat with no covering save such a shelter as could be\r\nmade with branches of trees, and because we were not disposed to ask\r\neither Mistress Rouse or Mistress Devoll to lend us blankets, we made\r\na lively blaze in the fireplace, laying ourselves down with our feet\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nThe night was cold indeed and we suffered not a little before morning;\r\nbut, as Ben said, it was better to be a trifle chilly than to feel\r\nourselves beholden to any one, even for that with which we covered\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI insisted that our first duty should be to get together a supply of\r\nfuel, and indeed there was no scarcity about. The trees grew so near\r\nthe water\'s edge that we could hew them into four-foot lengths, and\r\nalmost toss them into the flatboat.\r\n\r\nIt was my proposition that we fill the craft entirely with fuel\r\nbefore doing anything else, but Ben was so set upon seeing the Indian\r\nencampment, that he refused to do more than cut enough to last during\r\none night, and when I asked him what he intended to do about breakfast,\r\nhe quietly announced that he would rather go hungry one day, than miss\r\nthe chance of seeing those savages with whom we might, at some time in\r\nthe near future, find ourselves fighting for our lives.\r\n\r\nI also was eager to see the Indians; but not to such an extent that I\r\nwould cross over to Fort Harmar with an empty stomach. I therefore told\r\nhim that I should first make it my duty to go into the woods in search\r\nof game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VISITING THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nHe, however, was so insistent that we finally agreed that the forenoon\r\nshould be spent in looking at the savages, and after that he was to go\r\nwith me hunting.\r\n\r\nIt was odd, when we had come to Fort Harmar, to see so many of the\r\nbrown-skinned people dressed in fanciful garb, as if taking part in\r\nsome comical festival; but there was about them so much which was\r\ndisagreeable, that I could not really enjoy the visit.\r\n\r\nI fancied that more than one of them looked in an unfriendly manner at\r\nus, as if taking offense because of our curiosity, and I was willing\r\nto postpone any further acquaintance with them until we were somewhat\r\nfamiliar with their habits and customs.\r\n\r\nBen was not so eager as he had been, and when noon came was ready to\r\naccompany me on a hunting trip, as had been agreed upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI wish I had the time to tell you all we did during that first\r\nafternoon, for indeed it was most interesting.\r\n\r\nRoaming through a dirty Indian encampment was not for a single moment\r\nto be compared with the pleasure of making one\'s way among the huge\r\ntrees, where game was so abundant that a fellow might pick and choose.\r\n\r\nBefore we had gone half a mile from the fortification, we came upon\r\npigeons and rabbits in what seemed countless numbers, and more than\r\nonce did we get a glimpse of wild turkeys; but as yet we were not\r\nsufficiently versed in hunting to be able to kill them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithin two hours we had enough meat for the coming week, and, hastening\r\nback to our flatboat home, were able before sunset to cut so much wood\r\nthat Ben declared we might live like gentlemen of leisure during the\r\nnext few days.\r\n\r\n"If we are to make for ourselves names of worth in this country, there\r\nmust be no idleness," I said half laughingly. "You and I have decided\r\nthat we will strike out for ourselves, therefore it stands us in hand\r\nto earn money, and that without loss of time."\r\n\r\n"We will begin bright and early to-morrow morning," Ben replied\r\ncheerily. "You shall go one way and I another, each seeking to find\r\nsome way by which we can earn an honest dollar, and each seeing to it\r\nthat whatever business is engaged upon, shall be for two, because, as I\r\nunderstand it, you and I are to work in one yoke while we remain here\r\nin this town of Marietta."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CAPTAIN HASKELL\'S ADVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not do exactly as Ben proposed when another day had come, and it\r\nwas none other than Captain Haskell who prevented us from carrying out\r\nour plans.\r\n\r\nWe met the captain just as we were coming out from beneath our shelter,\r\nhe having strolled that way in order to learn how we might be getting\r\non. Seeing that we were blue and shivering with the cold as we strove\r\nto kindle a fire in the stern of the flatboat, he said to us that it\r\nwould be a good idea if we made of the craft a comfortable home during\r\nthe winter months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen he showed us how, with a little labor, we could build in the\r\nstern of the flatboat a shelter which would be quite as good as any\r\nhut on shore, save that we might be lodged in one of the best rooms in\r\nCampus Martius, and advised that we set about the work before striving\r\nto find employment. At the same time he assured us there was no doubt\r\nwhatsoever in his mind but that two lads who were willing to work, and\r\nwho would work, might make for themselves a home and a name.\r\n\r\nHaving given this advice, he turned squarely about, never waiting to\r\nsee whether we might be willing to follow it, and walked rapidly toward\r\nthe fortification.\r\n\r\nWe pondered over his suggestion no longer than it might take a man to\r\ncount twenty, and then began to discuss how we had best begin the work,\r\nin the meanwhile warming up what remained of the roasted pigeons we had\r\ncooked for supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A NEW FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged, the lad Jeremy Salter, of whom I have\r\nalready spoken, came down to the shore, curious to see who might be\r\nremaining on board a flatboat when there was shelter to be had in the\r\ntown, and without waiting for an invitation, joined us at breakfast,\r\neating considerably more than his share. He told us exactly how we\r\nought to set about making the shelter, and what it might be possible\r\nfor us to do in the way of gaining employment.\r\n\r\nAt first it nettled me that this boy should presume to advise us, for\r\nhe was considerably younger than I; but before he had done with his\r\nsuggestions, both Ben and I saw that they were not without merit.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of one of the Salters who had come out from Danvers, and\r\nconsidered himself an old resident of the country because of having\r\nbeen here two months or more. It appeared that he was not very eager to\r\ngain employment for himself, claiming that his father was one of those\r\nwho expected to go farther down the river in the spring to make there\r\nanother settlement.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must say in his favor that he took hold with us heartily,\r\nborrowing two axes, and advising which trees might be felled the\r\neasiest, performing himself a due share of the labor, with the result\r\nthat before two days had passed, thanks to his assistance and advice,\r\nwe had as good a hut built over the fireplace in the stern of the\r\nflatboat as one could desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FISHING THROUGH THE ICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Jeremy Salter told us how we might lay in a store of provisions\r\nwithout spending powder and ball. His scheme was to go a short distance\r\nfrom the point, and there fish through the ice.\r\n\r\nHe not only gave this advice but went so far as to provide us with\r\nfishing tackle, and seemed to enjoy himself hugely while aiding in\r\nlaying up a store of food.\r\n\r\nIt was no labor, but rather sport, to catch fish in this fashion. We\r\ncaught them as fast as it was possible to haul in the lines, until when\r\nnight came and we had made a sort of sled with branches of trees, we\r\nhad as much of a load as we cared to drag over the ice.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were all frozen, therefore we stacked them up like\r\nfuel in the bow of the flatboat, and I dare say that had we lived on\r\nfish alone, we had in the ten hours\' fishing enough food for a month.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time that we were building our hut and fishing, Ben\r\nCushing was eager to pay another visit to the Indian encampment; but\r\nJeremy declared that the savages were not in the most friendly mood,\r\neven though they had come to make a treaty, and his father had told him\r\nplainly that he must not venture near the lodges, lest harm might come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch talk as this served to take away Ben\'s desire to see the wild\r\nsavages in their own camps, and I was glad because of it, for instead\r\nof spending half a day when time was precious, we, with Jeremy\'s aid,\r\nset about laying up a greater store of fuel, until the flatboat had a\r\nfull cargo of wood and fish, therefore we need not fear hunger or cold\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SABBATH IN MARIETTA\r\n\r\n\r\nI was glad indeed when the Sabbath came, for I had worked hard and the\r\ntime of rest was what all of us, including Jeremy, who was living with\r\nus rather than in Campus Martius with his parents, most needed.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the people assembled in one of the rooms of\r\nCampus Martius during the forenoon, where prayers were read and some of\r\nthe older men talked to us in serious fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe words at that time took even more hold on me than those which I had\r\nheard from Parson Cutler\'s lips at home, for we were indeed needing the\r\nprotection of God, since there were none of this world who could aid\r\nif the savages attacked us suddenly. I believe that both Ben and I came\r\naway from that meeting better in heart and with better resolutions for\r\nthe future, than we had ever had before.\r\n\r\nBright and early on Monday morning Captain Haskell made us another\r\nvisit and commented favorably upon the shelter we had built, at the\r\nsame time that he looked curiously at our stack of fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I see no reason why you lads should not sell me half a dozen of\r\nthese," he said, picking out some of the finest, and Ben Cushing\r\nreplied promptly that he might have all he wanted for the carrying away.\r\n\r\nThe captain refused any such offer, saying that he would buy them,\r\notherwise he would go without, and declaring that if we wished, we\r\nmight sell to the people inside the fortification no small amount of\r\nfish during the winter season, for there were plenty who did not feel\r\ndisposed to spend their time on the river while the weather was so\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A REGULAR BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gave us a shilling for as many as he could carry, and bade us follow\r\nhim to Campus Martius, where within an hour we took orders for as many\r\nas we had in the flatboat, at prices much the same as that paid by the\r\ncaptain, and straightway without our seeking it, there came to us a\r\nmeans of earning money sufficient to provide ourselves with ammunition\r\nfor hunting.\r\n\r\nYou would not have the patience to read all I could write about our\r\nwork during that winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was never man nor woman in Campus Martius who could come out and\r\nbeckon us, but that we were ready to furnish him or her with as much\r\nfish as was wanted, until we had gathered in no less than seven dollars\r\nand three shillings, by working in a way which was much like sport. Of\r\nthis amount we spent a little more than one half to purchase a store\r\nof powder and lead, for it was our intention to add the business of\r\nhunting to that of fishing.\r\n\r\nThanks to Jeremy Salter, we borrowed from a kind man who had come out\r\nwith Colonel Sproat two muskets, with the understanding that if at any\r\ntime before spring we were ready to pay twelve dollars for each, they\r\nmight become our property.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on we fished when the weather was too stormy for\r\nsuccessful hunting, and roamed the woods during pleasant days, coming\r\nback to our flatboat home each night literally laden with game or fish;\r\nand although any man in Marietta could have done the same, we had no\r\ndifficulty in selling it all.\r\n\r\nOf the ceremony of making the treaty with the Indians we saw nothing,\r\nand for the very good reason that we could not afford to spend the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A VISIT FROM THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nJust then it seemed as if every man in the settlement was eager to know\r\nwhat might be going on around Fort Harmar, and therefore the demands\r\nupon us hunters increased to such an extent that we could hardly supply\r\nthe food which was desired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that we were unable to be present during\r\nthe treaty making, save at the price of losing the chance to earn\r\nconsiderable money, Ben Cushing had lost all desire to see the savages\r\nat close quarters.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon just before sunset, when we had come in from fishing,\r\ntwo Delaware braves came over to our flatboat and made themselves very\r\nmuch at home, without any invitation. In fact, they carried matters\r\nwith a high hand, as if having the right to do as they pleased, and\r\nwhen Ben made a stout protest against their eating the food intended\r\nfor our own supper, one of them behaved in such a threatening manner\r\nthat for a moment I thoroughly believed he was about to strike the lad\r\ndown, therefore I hastily caught up one of the axes, believing I should\r\nbe called upon to fight for my life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians had eaten until it was impossible to eat more, they\r\nhaving literally forced us to cook for them, the two stalked away, and\r\nfrom that time forth Ben never said anything regarding a desire to\r\nvisit the encampment.\r\n\r\nWe hunted or fished during every moment of daylight while the treaty\r\nmaking was going on, and when it had come to an end we had so many\r\ndollars in our possession as satisfied us fully for having failed to\r\nwitness the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BUILDING A HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, when we were so prosperous, that Jeremy Salter\r\ndeclared we ought to set aside a certain day in each week for the work\r\nof building a house for ourselves on the eight-acre lot, which we now\r\nknew could be paid for at any time, since we had more than sufficient\r\nmoney in our possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus, thanks to Jeremy, we set about building our home, working\r\nwhenever the demand for game or fish was light, or when it stormed so\r\nfuriously that we could not well go on the river or in the woods. When\r\nspring came and the snow had disappeared, we had as solidly built a\r\ncabin as could be found anywhere in Marietta outside Campus Martius.\r\n\r\nThus far we had accomplished a portion of our purpose. The people had\r\ncome to understand that if we promised to provide them with a certain\r\nkind of game or fish, the promise would be kept to the letter. I am\r\nsaying this not to praise myself, but simply to show we were making a\r\nname for ourselves as lads who told the truth, and kept strictly to\r\ntheir bargain.\r\n\r\nAs I looked at the matter, this was of greatest value to us. We had set\r\nabout gaining a good reputation, and verily we had begun aright, though\r\nonly in small matters. It remained to show whether we were of such\r\nstuff as settlers in a wild country should be made.\r\n\r\nBefore the first day of March we had paid for our eight-acre lot, had\r\nbuilt a cabin of two rooms, in which was stored as much frozen game and\r\nfish as would keep sweet until warm weather came, and, in addition, had\r\nnineteen dollars which we could call our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A GREAT PROJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, when the rain came down in torrents, and we were not inclined\r\neither to fish or hunt, Captain Haskell came to make a friendly call,\r\nand, in no spirit of curiosity, but rather because of the interest\r\nwhich he had evidently taken in us, asked how we were progressing.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation I told him exactly how we stood in the world,\r\nwhereupon he praised us highly, and then proposed a scheme which fairly\r\ncaused me to hold my breath in amazement, for it did not seem possible\r\nwe could venture so far as his plan led.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis idea was that we build a water mill by buying from himself and\r\nMaster Rouse the flatboat in which we were still living and by putting\r\nalongside of it a second one, the two to be fastened side by side in\r\nsuch a manner that a water wheel could be worked between them, and the\r\ndouble craft anchored in the current, where sufficient power could be\r\nhad to drive the mill.\r\n\r\nAs to the stones for grinding and such small pieces of machinery as we\r\nmight need, he figured that we could buy them either in Pittsburgh or\r\nfrom some craft which came up the river, and when I asked him how far\r\nhe thought our store of money would go in such a project, he laughingly\r\nreplied that Uncle Daniel and he would lend us a sufficient amount to\r\npay for all we might need, and take from us in return three-quarters of\r\nthe entire earnings until the debt, with interest, had been canceled.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben Cushing asked if he believed we should find business enough to\r\nwarrant the undertaking, he replied:--\r\n\r\n"There are about two hundred people here now and twice as many coming\r\nfrom Massachusetts during the summer. Now, since there is no mill here\r\nand all the corn must be ground by hand, I am asking whether you do not\r\nbelieve that by harvest time a single mill such as Uncle Daniel and\r\nI propose you shall build, will be kept running during every hour of\r\ndaylight?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TWO MILLERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe discussed the matter earnestly, as you may well suppose, and Uncle\r\nDaniel, coming aboard before we had finished the conversation, did his\r\nshare of arguing. Before nightfall it was settled that on the following\r\nmorning we should begin work on a second flatboat, and also repair the\r\nold craft in which we had come down from Sumrill\'s Ferry.\r\n\r\nAnd all this we did, working with a hearty will far into each night,\r\nbecause it was possible to see before us a way of getting on in the\r\nworld faster than we had ever dared to dream, and you may be sure we\r\nwasted no minute of daylight.\r\n\r\nWe had expected to cultivate our eight acres, and, in fact, when\r\nspring came we did put in a crop of corn; but the making of the mill\r\nand providing ourselves with food occupied so much of our time that we\r\ncould not well afford to spend many hours as farmers, more particularly\r\nsince both Uncle Daniel and Captain Haskell insisted that as soon as\r\nthe mill was in working order we could earn double or treble as much as\r\nit would be possible to get from the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd it all came about as these two good friends of ours predicted. The\r\nmill was a success from the first day we were ready to turn the wheel,\r\nand has continued so until now, when we are in sorest trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SAVAGES ON THE WARPATH\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of our coming into this Ohio country, Marietta had\r\nsteadily increased in size, the people coming, as it seemed to me,\r\nfrom every part of the eastern colonies, and just when Ben and I were\r\ncongratulating each other that our lines had been cast in peaceful,\r\npleasant places, even though we were settled in the wilderness, the\r\nIndians began their bloody work which we now fear may result in wiping\r\nout this settlement.\r\n\r\nThe treaty which had been made by the savages just after we arrived was\r\nkept only by the white men. Hardly more than two weeks ago news came\r\nthat Captain King had been killed at that settlement to which Uncle\r\nDaniel went in the spring, while four others were slain in the forest,\r\nand one taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe savages are in arms against us. We have been forced to come into\r\nCampus Martius for safety; work of all kinds has been abandoned; our\r\nmill is moored far up the Muskingum River, where we have a faint hope\r\nit may escape destruction.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be that within the next four and twenty hours both Ben\r\nand I will have fallen beneath the tomahawk, yet must I bear witness\r\nthat God has been good to us indeed. He has permitted two lads so to\r\nmake their way in the world with nothing save their own hands as stock\r\nin trade, that now, as I have good reason for believing, we are counted\r\namong the responsible citizens of the town.\r\n\r\nAnd of this it seems to me I had good proof no longer ago than\r\nyesterday, when I heard General Putnam say while he and some other of\r\nthe men were discussing the possibilities of an Indian war:--\r\n\r\n"If evidence were needed that it is well for young, willing workers to\r\ncome into the wilderness, then I would point out to you that lad who\r\njourneyed with Mistress Devoll, and who, with his comrade, has laid\r\nup more than a fair share of this world\'s goods by unceasing work and\r\nunswerving honesty. He has done no more than many another might have\r\ndone; but it has pleased me to watch the lad, and when I think of him\r\nit is always as our cheery-faced, upright miller, Benjamin of Ohio."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              BOOKS CONSULTED IN WRITING BENJAMIN OF OHIO\r\n\r\n\r\n   BALDWIN, JAMES: Conquest of the Old Northwest.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org \r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\r\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
